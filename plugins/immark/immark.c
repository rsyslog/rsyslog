/* This function is called to gather input. It must terminate only

 * This code must simply spawn emit a mark message at each mark interval.
 * We are running on our own thread, so this is extremely easy: we just
 * sleep MarkInterval seconds and each time we awake, we inject the message.
 * Please note that we do not do the other fancy things that sysklogd

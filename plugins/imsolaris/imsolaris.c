/* imsolaris.c
 * This input module is used to gather local log data under Solaris. This
 * includes messages from local applications AS WELL AS the kernel log.
 * I first considered to make all of this available via imklog, but that
 * did not lock appropriately on second thought. So I created this module
 * that does anything for local message recption.
 *
 * This module is not meant to be used on plaforms other than Solaris. As
 * such, trying to compile it elswhere will probably fail with all sorts
 * of errors.
 *
 * Some notes on the Solaris syslog mechanism:
 * Both system (kernel) and application log messages are provided via
 * a single message stream.
 *
 * Solaris checks if the syslogd is running. If so, syslog() emits messages
 * to the log socket, only. Otherwise, it emits messages to the console.
 * It is possible to gather these console messages as well. However, then
 * we clutter the console.
 * Solaris does this "syslogd alive check" in a somewhat unexpected way
 * (at least unexpected for me): it uses the so-called "door" mechanism, a
 * fast RPC facility. I first thought that the door API was used to submit
 * the actual syslog messages. But this is not the case. Instead, a door
 * call is done, and the server process inside rsyslog simply does NOTHING
 * but return. All that Solaris sylsogd() is interested in is if the door
 * server (we) responds and thus can be considered alive. The actual message
 * is then submitted via the usual stream. I have to admit I do not
 * understand why the message itself is not passed via this high-performance
 * API. But anyhow, that's nothing I can change, so the most important thing
 * is to note how Solaris does this thing ;)
 * The syslog() library call checks syslogd state for *each* call (what a
 * waste of time...) and decides each time if the message should go to the
 * console or not.  According to OpenSolaris sources, it looks like there is
 * message loss potential when the door file is created before all data has
 * been pulled from the stream. While I have to admit that I do not fully
 * understand that problem, I will follow the original code advise and do
 * one complete pull cycle on the log socket (until it has no further data
 * available) and only thereafter create the door file and start the "regular"
 * pull cycle. As of my understanding, there is a minimal race between the
 * point where the intial pull cycle has ended and the door file is created,
 * but that race is also present in OpenSolaris syslogd code, so it should
 * not matter that much (plus, I do not know how to avoid it...)

-------------------------------------------------------
This is plumbing that DOES NOT need to be CHANGED
-------------------------------------------------------
Implementor's note: Python seems to very agressively
buffer stdout. The end result was that rsyslog does not
receive the script's messages in a timely manner (sometimes
even never, probably due to races). To prevent this, we
flush stdout after we have done processing. This is especially
important once we get to the point where the plugin does
two-way conversations with rsyslog. Do NOT change this!

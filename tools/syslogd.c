 * rsyslog had initially been forked from the sysklogd project.
 * I would like to express my thanks to the developers of the sysklogd
 * package - without it, I would have had a much harder start...
 *
 * Please note that while rsyslog started from the sysklogd code base,
 * it nowadays has almost nothing left in common with it. Allmost all
 * parts of the code have been rewritten.

 * Note: this stems back to sysklogd, so we cannot put it under ASL 2.0. But
 * we may want to check if the code inside the BSD sources is exactly the same
 * (remember that sysklogd forked the BSD sources). If so, the BSD license applies
 * and permits us to move to ASL 2.0 (but we need to check the fine details). 
 * Probably it is best just to rewrite this code.

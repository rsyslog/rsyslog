# AGENTS.md â€“ Built-in tool modules

The `tools/` directory holds historic built-in modules that share code with the
core but are compiled directly into the rsyslog binary:

- `omfile.c`
- `omusrmsg.c`
- `omfwd.c`
- `ompipe.c`
- `omshell.c`
- `omdiscard.c`

## Build & testing expectations
- These modules are always built as part of the default configuration; no
  additional `./configure` flags are required.
- Follow the top-level build workflow: run `./autogen.sh` only when autotools
  inputs change, configure with the options your change requires, and rebuild via
  `make`.
- There are no standalone regression scripts for these built-in modules. When
  modifying them, rely on targeted configuration tests under `tests/` (e.g.
  `./tests/omfile-basic.sh`) or add new ones as needed.

## Metadata
- Shared metadata lives in `tools/MODULE_METADATA.json` so we do not duplicate
  YAML files beside each source.
- Keep the JSON array sorted by module name and update the `last_reviewed` field
  whenever support status, maturity, or contacts change.
- The default `primary_contact` points at the rsyslog GitHub Discussions and
  Issues queue; replace it with a specific maintainer only when a new owner is
  explicitly assigned.

## Documentation touchpoints
- Most of these modules have reference guides under
  `doc/source/configuration/modules/`. Update the relevant `.rst` files when you
  change defaults or add features.
- Cross-reference changes in `doc/ai/module_map.yaml` if the concurrency or
  locking guidance shifts.

# Rsyslog Issue Assistant (beta)

Use this tool to turn a raw problem/idea into a high-quality GitHub issue.
- Output is ASCII only and ready to paste into GitHub.
- It selects the correct issue type (bug, feature, documentation, packaging, performance).
- It proposes repo, title, labels, and a complete body matching rsyslog templates.

Implementation note: the assistant consumes the base prompt file:

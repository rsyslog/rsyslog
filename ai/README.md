# AI and Machine Learning Tooling for rsyslog

This directory contains AI and Machine Learning (ML) tools that

---
## Purpose

The `ai` directory is designated for a new generation of tooling that will
interface with rsyslog. It will house external AI and ML models and
applications. This approach ensures the rsyslog core remains lean and
robust while allowing for flexible and powerful extensions.

---
## Current Status

**No tools exist yet.**

This directory and its `README.md` have been created to provide a
consistent and official location for this work as it progresses.
Active development is ongoing, and tools will be added here once they
reach a stable state.

---
## Vision

Future tools in this directory will leverage artificial intelligence and
machine learning for tasks like advanced log analysis, anomaly detection,
and intelligent system monitoring. The goal is to enhance rsyslog's
capabilities without integrating complex models directly into the core
daemon.

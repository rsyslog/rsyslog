# AGENTS.md – rsyslog Repository Agent Guide

This file defines guidelines and instructions for AI assistants (e.g., Codex, GitHub Copilot Workspace, ChatGPT agents) to understand and contribute effectively to the rsyslog codebase.

## Repository Overview

  - **Primary Language**: C
  - **Build System**: autotools (`autogen.sh`, `configure`, `make`)
  - **Modules**: Dynamically loaded from `plugins/`
  - **Contrib Modules**: Community-contributed under `contrib/`
  - **Contributions**: Additional modules and features are placed in `contrib/`, which contains community-contributed plugins not actively maintained by the core rsyslog team. These are retained in `contrib/` even if adopted later, to avoid disruptions in dependent software.
  - **Documentation**: Maintained in the doc/ subdirectory
  - **AI module map**: `doc/ai/module_map.yaml` (per-module paths & locking hints)
  - **docker definitions**: Maintained in the packaging/docker/ subdirectory
  - **Side Libraries** (each in its own repo within the rsyslog GitHub org):
      - [`liblognorm`](https://github.com/rsyslog/liblognorm)
      - [`librelp`](https://github.com/rsyslog/librelp)
      - [`libestr`](https://github.com/rsyslog/libestr)
      - [`libfastjson`](https://github.com/rsyslog/libfastjson): A fork of libfastjson by the rsyslog project, optimized for speed.
        This library is used by multiple external projects.

## Priming a fresh AI session

When starting a new AI-assisted coding session (for example after a PR merges or
the workspace is reset):

1. Share this repository-level guide and the relevant subtree `AGENTS.md`
   files (`plugins/`, `contrib/`, `doc/`, `tools/`, etc.) so the agent absorbs
   the area-specific build and testing workflows.
2. Provide the module metadata (`MODULE_METADATA.yaml` or `tools/MODULE_METADATA.json`)
   for components being modified so ownership, support channels, and maturity
   are clear.
3. Supply the commit assistant or doc builder prompt that matches the task type
   (see the quick links above) to keep commit messages and documentation edits
   consistent.
4. Include any recent design or review notes that are not yet in the repository
   so the agent understands outstanding context.

These steps mirror how the existing sandbox is configured and make it more
likely that rebuild/bootstrap reminders (such as running `./autogen.sh` before
the first compile) are followed.

-----

## Automated Formatting Normalization Strategy

We treat formatting as a normalization step, not a developer-side constraint.
AI agents should follow this process:

1.  Canonical formatting via clang-format
    Use the Google-style base with 4-space indentation in .clang-format.

2.  Helper-based normalization
    Run devtools/format-code.sh to run clang-format and potential helper scripts.

3.  Developer freedom & accessibility
    Local formatting is unrestricted; only normalized output matters.

4.  CI enforcement & maintainer assist
    CI checks formatting; maintainers may edit PRs directly.

5.  Git blame hygiene
    Formatting-only commits listed in .git-blame-ignore-revs.

AI Agent Note: run devtools/format-code.sh as the final formatting step before commit.

-----

## Development Workflow

### Base Repository

- URL: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog
- **Default base branch: `main`**
  > The `main` branch is now the canonical base for all development.
  > Some older references to `master` may still exist in documentation
  > or tooling and will be updated as needed.

### Contributor Workflow

1.  Fork the repository (for personal development)
2.  Create a feature/fix branch
3.  Push changes to your fork
4.  Open a **pull request directly into `rsyslog/rsyslog:main`**

> **Important**: AI-generated PRs must target the `rsyslog/rsyslog` repository directly.

-----

## Branch Naming Conventions

There are no strict naming rules, but these conventions are used frequently:

  - For issue-based work: `i-<issue-number>` (e.g., `i-2245`)
  - For features or refactoring: free-form is acceptable
  - For AI-generated work: prefix the branch name with the AI tool name
    (e.g., `gpt-i-2245-json-stats-export`)

-----

## Coding Standards

  - Commit messages **must include all relevant information**, not just in the PR
  - Commit message titles **must not exceed 62 characters**
  - commit message text must be plain US ASCII, line length must not exceed 72 characters
  - When referencing GitHub issues, use the **full GitHub URL** to assist in `git log`-based reviews
  - Favor **self-documenting code** over excessive inline comments
  - Public functions should use Doxygen-style comments
  - See `COMMENTING_STYLE.md` for detailed Doxygen guidelines
  - Modules must implement and register `modInit()` and `modExit()`

When fixing compiler warnings like `stringop-overread`, explain in the commit message:

  - Why the warning occurred
  - What part of the code was changed
  - How the fix prevents undefined behavior or aligns with compiler expectations
  - Optionally link: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wstringop-overread

-----

## Editor & Formatting Configuration

The repository includes:

  - `.editorconfig`: Editor-agnostic indent, whitespace, EOL, and file-type rules.
  - Project `.vimrc`/`.exrc`: Vim settings when `set exrc secure` is enabled.
  - `.clang-format`: Canonical C/C++ style; run `clang-format -i -style=file`.
  - `devtools/format-code.sh`: Runs clang-format plus helper fixups.

Editors and IDEs with EditorConfig support (VS Code, JetBrains, Sublime, Vim, Emacs)
will automatically apply these rules.

-----

## Build & Test Expectations

Whenever `.c` or `.h` files are modified, a build should be performed using `make`.
If new functionality is introduced, at least a basic test should be created and run.

### Generating the autotools build system

The `configure` script and `Makefile.in` files are **not** stored in git. After a
fresh checkout—or any time `configure.ac`, `Makefile.am`, or macros under `m4/`
change—you **must** run:

```bash
./autogen.sh
```

This bootstraps autotools, downloads any required macros, and generates
`configure`. Skipping this step is the most common reason for messages such as
`configure: error: cannot find install-sh, install.sh, or shtool` or `make:
*** No targets specified and no makefile found`. If a cleanup removed the
generated files (e.g., `git clean -xfd`), re-run `./autogen.sh` before
configuring again.

If `autogen.sh` fails, run `./devtools/codex-setup.sh` first to install the
toolchain dependencies inside the sandbox, then retry `./autogen.sh`.

### Configure & build

If possible, agents should:

  - Build the project using `./configure` and `make`
  - Run an individual test using the instructions below
  - After building, run `./tests/imtcp-basic.sh` as a smoke test unless another test is more appropriate

> In restricted environments, a build may not be possible. In such cases, ensure the
> generated code is clear and well-commented to aid review.

-----

## Testing & Validation

All test definitions live under the `tests/` directory and are driven by the `tests/diag.sh` framework. Continuous-integration jobs still execute the full suite via `make check`, but **AI agents should stick to direct test scripts** unless a reviewer explicitly requests a CI reproduction. Direct invocation keeps stdout/stderr visible and avoids the 10+ minute runtime of the harness.

Avoiding the harness matters because `make check`:

  - Wraps tests in a harness that hides stdout/stderr on failure
  - Requires parsing `tests/test-suite.log` for details
  - Consumes significant resources on large suites

Instead, AI agents should invoke individual test scripts directly. This yields unfiltered output and immediate feedback, without the CI harness. The `diag.sh` framework now builds any required test support automatically, so there is **no longer** a need for a separate “build core components” step.

-----

### Running Individual Tests (AI-Agent Best Practice)

1.  **Configure the project** (once per session):
    ```bash
    ./configure --enable-imdiag --enable-testbench
    ```
2.  **Invoke your test**:
    ```bash
    ./tests/<test-script>.sh
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    ./tests/manytcp-too-few-tls-vg.sh > /tmp/test.log && tail -n20 /tmp/test.log
    ```
3.  **Why this works**
      - Each test script transparently finds and loads the test harness
      - You get unfiltered stdout/stderr without any CI wrapper
      - No manual `cd` or log-file parsing required

-----

### Full Test Suite (CI-Only)

For continuous-integration pipelines or when you explicitly need to validate the entire suite, use the autotools harness:

```bash
./configure --enable-imdiag --enable-testbench
make check
```

  - To limit parallelism (avoid flaky failures), pass `-j2` or `-j4` to `make`.
  - If a failure occurs, inspect `tests/test-suite.log` for detailed diagnostics.
  - Note in your report why a full harness run was necessary so reviewers understand the extra runtime.

-----

### Test Environment

Human developers can replicate CI conditions using the official container images available on **Docker Hub**. For single-test runs, we recommend `rsyslog/rsyslog_dev_base_ubuntu:24.04`. Please note that **AI agents should not attempt to pull or run these images**. Instead, they should utilize the standard configure + direct-test workflow within their existing container environment.

-----

## Manual Setup (discouraged)

Minimum setup requires:

  - Autotools toolchain: `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`, `make`, `gcc`
  - Side libraries: `libestr`, `librelp`, `libfastjson`, `liblognorm` (must be installed or built manually)

Example commands (swap the final step for the most relevant smoke test):

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-debug --enable-testbench
make -j$(nproc)
./tests/imtcp-basic.sh
```

Reserve `make check` for cases where you must mirror CI or chase harness-only failures. When you do run it, prefer `make check -j2` or `-j4` for reliability.

-----

### Codex Build Environment Setup

Codex-based agents must only perform this setup **if a compile or test is required** (e.g., not for review-only tasks):

  - Run this setup script to install core dependencies:
    ```bash
    ./devtools/codex-setup.sh
    ```
  - Then, always run:
    ```bash
    ./autogen.sh
    ```

This ensures Codex can build core components even in constrained environments. Skipping setup when not needed (e.g., code review) saves significant execution time.

-----

## AI-Specific Hints

  - The `plugins/` directory contains dynamically loaded input/output plugins
  - `contrib/` contains external contributions (e.g., plugins) that are not core-maintained
  - `statsobj.c` implements the statistics interface
  - Documentation resides in the monorepo’s doc/ directory
  - You may reference `rsyslog-docker` for dev/test environment setup
  - Side libraries are external GitHub repos, not subdirectories

  - **Shell Script Documentation**
    Use shdoc-style comments (`##`, `###`) in new and updated Bash scripts to enable automatic Markdown extraction. Many existing scripts lack these; it's **strongly recommended** to add them when modifying or creating scripts.

When generating or editing code, prefer:

  - Clean modular design
  - Compatibility and backward safety
  - Updating structured comments (e.g., Doxygen for C code)

-----

## AI Agent Commit Convention

If you are an AI agent contributing code or documentation:

  - Use the same rich commit message text as your PR description.
  - Avoid generating multiple PRs for retries — reuse and update the original PR when possible.
  - Follow the same **commit message policy** as human contributors:
      - Describe **what changed** and **why** (as far as known to the agent).
      - Note any impact on existing versions or behaviors (especially for bug fixes).
  - Commit message descriptions should clearly identify that they were generated or co-authored by an AI tool.
  - Include a **commit footer tag** like "AI-Agent: Codex"
  - **Use the canonical commit-message base prompt** to draft/lint messages (ASCII, 62/72 wrap, `<component>:` title, non-tech “why”, Impact, Before/After, full-URL Fixes/Refs):
    ai/rsyslog_commit_assistant/base_prompt.txt
  - **Commit-first:** ensure the substance is in the commit body (not only the PR). If needed, amend before opening the PR (`git commit --amend`).

-----

## Privacy, Trust & Permissions

  - AI agents **must not** push changes directly to user forks — always open PRs against `rsyslog/rsyslog`
  - Do not install third-party dependencies unless explicitly approved
  - PRs must pass standard CI and review checks
  - All code **must be reviewed manually**; AI output is subject to full review

-----

## Quickstart for AI coding agents (v8 concurrency & state)

**Read these first:**
* [`DEVELOPING.md`](./DEVELOPING.md) — v8 worker model & locking rules
* [`MODULE_AUTHOR_CHECKLIST.md`](./MODULE_AUTHOR_CHECKLIST.md) — one-screen checklist
* [doc/ai/module_map.yaml](./doc/ai/module_map.yaml) — seed list of modules, paths, and known locking needs

**Rules you must not break**
1. The framework may run **multiple workers per action**.
2. `wrkrInstanceData_t` (WID) is **per-worker**; never share it.
3. Shared mutable state lives in **pData** (per-action) and **must be protected**
   by the module (mutex/rwlock). Do **not** rely on `mutAction` for this.
4. **Inherently serial resources** (e.g., a shared stream) must be serialized
   inside the module via a mutex in **pData**.
5. **Direct queues** do not remove the need to serialize serial resources.

**Common agent tasks**
* Consult `doc/ai/module_map.yaml` to understand module paths and known locking.
* Add a “Concurrency & Locking” block at the top of output modules.
* Ensure serial modules guard stream/flush with a **pData** mutex.
* For modules with a library I/O thread (e.g., Proton), verify read/write locks
  are taken on **all** callback paths.

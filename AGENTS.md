# AGENTS.md – rsyslog Repository Agent Guide

This file defines guidelines and instructions for AI assistants (e.g., Codex, GitHub Copilot Workspace, ChatGPT agents) to understand and contribute effectively to the rsyslog codebase.

## Repository Overview

  - **Primary Language**: C
  - **Build System**: autotools (`autogen.sh`, `configure`, `make`)
  - **Modules**: Dynamically loaded from `plugins/`
  - **Contrib Modules**: Community-contributed under `contrib/`
  - **Contributions**: Additional modules and features are placed in `contrib/`, which contains community-contributed plugins not actively maintained by the core rsyslog team. These are retained in `contrib/` even if adopted later, to avoid disruptions in dependent software.
  - **Documentation**: Maintained in the doc/ subdirectory
  - **AI module map**: `doc/ai/module_map.yaml` (per-module paths & locking hints)
  - **docker definitions**: Maintained in the packaging/docker/ subdirectory
  - **Side Libraries** (each in its own repo within the rsyslog GitHub org):
      - [`liblognorm`](https://github.com/rsyslog/liblognorm)
      - [`librelp`](https://github.com/rsyslog/librelp)
      - [`libestr`](https://github.com/rsyslog/libestr)
      - [`libfastjson`](https://github.com/rsyslog/libfastjson): A fork of libfastjson by the rsyslog project, optimized for speed. This library is used by multiple external projects.

## Automated Formatting Normalization Strategy

We treat formatting as a normalization step, not a developer-side constraint.
AI agents should follow this process:

1.  Canonical formatting via clang-format
    Use the Google-style base with 4-space indentation in .clang-format.

2.  Helper-based normalization
    Run devtools/format-code.sh to run clang-format and potential helper scripts.

3.  Developer freedom & accessibility
    Local formatting is unrestricted; only normalized output matters.

4.  CI enforcement & maintainer assist
    CI checks formatting; maintainers may edit PRs directly.

5.  Git blame hygiene
    Formatting-only commits listed in .git-blame-ignore-revs.

Prerequisite: install `clang-format` so the formatter can run

- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y clang-format`
- macOS (Homebrew): `brew install clang-format`
- Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install clang-tools-extra`

AI Agent Note: Always run `./devtools/format-code.sh` as the final step before commit and push. CI will reject PRs with formatting violations.

-----

## Development Workflow

### Base Repository

- URL: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog
- **Default base branch: `main`**
  > The `main` branch is now the canonical base for all development.
  > Some older references to `master` may still exist in documentation
  > or tooling and will be updated as needed.

### Contributor Workflow

1.  Fork the repository (for personal development)
2.  Create a feature/fix branch
3.  Implement your changes
4.  Run the formatter before committing (install `clang-format` if missing):
    - `./devtools/format-code.sh`
    - Ensure a clean diff for style-only changes
5.  Commit and push your branch
6.  Open a **pull request directly into `rsyslog/rsyslog:main`**

> **Important**: AI-generated PRs must target the `rsyslog/rsyslog` repository directly.

-----

## Branch Naming Conventions

There are no strict naming rules, but these conventions are used frequently:

  - For issue-based work: `i-<issue-number>` (e.g., `i-2245`)
  - For features or refactoring: free-form is acceptable
  - For AI-generated work: prefix the branch name with the AI tool name
    (e.g., `gpt-i-2245-json-stats-export`)

-----

## Coding Standards

  - Commit messages **must include all relevant information**, not just in the PR
  - Commit message titles **must not exceed 62 characters**
  - commit message text must be plain US ASCII, line length must not exceed 72 characters
  - When referencing GitHub issues, use the **full GitHub URL** to assist in `git log`-based reviews
  - Favor **self-documenting code** over excessive inline comments
  - Public functions should use Doxygen-style comments
  - See `COMMENTING_STYLE.md` for detailed Doxygen guidelines
  - Modules must implement and register `modInit()` and `modExit()`

When fixing compiler warnings like `stringop-overread`, explain in the commit message:

  - Why the warning occurred
  - What part of the code was changed
  - How the fix prevents undefined behavior or aligns with compiler expectations
  - Optionally link: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wstringop-overread

-----

## Editor & Formatting Configuration

The repository includes:

  - `.editorconfig`: Editor-agnostic indent, whitespace, EOL, and file-type rules.
  - Project `.vimrc`/`.exrc`: Vim settings when `set exrc secure` is enabled.
  - `.clang-format`: Canonical C/C++ style; run `clang-format -i -style=file`.
  - `devtools/format-code.sh`: Runs clang-format plus helper fixups.

Editors and IDEs with EditorConfig support (VS Code, JetBrains, Sublime, Vim, Emacs)
will automatically apply these rules.

-----

## Build & Test Expectations

Whenever `.c` or `.h` files are modified, a build should be performed using `make`.
If new functionality is introduced, at least a basic test should be created and run.

If possible, agents should:

  - Build the project using `./configure` and `make`
  - Run an individual test using the instructions below
  - After building, run `./tests/imtcp-basic.sh` as a smoke test unless another test is more appropriate

> In restricted environments, a build may not be possible. In such cases, ensure the
> generated code is clear and well-commented to aid review.

-----

## Testing & Validation

All test definitions live under the `tests/` directory and are driven by the `tests/diag.sh` framework. In CI, `make check` remains the canonical way to run the full suite; **AI agents should avoid invoking `make check` by default**, because:

  - It wraps all tests in a harness that hides stdout/stderr on failure
  - It requires parsing `tests/test-suite.log` for details
  - It can take 10+ minutes and consume significant resources

Instead, AI agents should invoke individual test scripts directly. This yields unfiltered output and immediate feedback, without the CI harness. The `diag.sh` framework now builds any required test support automatically, so there is **no longer** a need for a separate “build core components” step.

-----

### Running Individual Tests (AI-Agent Best Practice)

1.  **Configure the project** (once per session):
    ```bash
    ./configure --enable-imdiag --enable-testbench
    ```
2.  **Invoke your test**:
    ```bash
    ./tests/<test-script>.sh
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    ./tests/manytcp-too-few-tls-vg.sh > /tmp/test.log && tail -n20 /tmp/test.log
    ```
3.  **Why this works**
      - Each test script transparently finds and loads the test harness
      - You get unfiltered stdout/stderr without any CI wrapper
      - No manual `cd` or log-file parsing required

-----

### Full Test Suite (CI-Only)

For continuous-integration pipelines or when you need to validate the entire suite, use the autotools harness:

```bash
./configure --enable-imdiag --enable-testbench
make check
```

  - To limit parallelism (avoid flaky failures), pass `-j2` or `-j4` to `make`.
  - If a failure occurs, inspect `tests/test-suite.log` for detailed diagnostics.

-----

### Test Environment

Human developers can replicate CI conditions using the official container images available on **Docker Hub**. For single-test runs, we recommend `rsyslog/rsyslog_dev_base_ubuntu:24.04`. Please note that **AI agents should not attempt to pull or run these images**. Instead, they should utilize the standard configure + direct-test workflow within their existing container environment.

-----

## Manual Setup (discouraged)

Minimum setup requires:

  - Autotools toolchain: `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`, `make`, `gcc`
  - Side libraries: `libestr`, `librelp`, `libfastjson`, `liblognorm` (must be installed or built manually)

Example commands:

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-debug --enable-testbench
make -j$(nproc)
make check
```

Use `make check -j2` or `-j4` max for reliability.

-----

### Codex Build Environment Setup

Codex-based agents must only perform this setup **if a compile or test is required** (e.g., not for review-only tasks):

  - Run this setup script to install core dependencies:
    ```bash
    ./devtools/codex-setup.sh
    ```
  - Then, always run:
    ```bash
    ./autogen.sh
    ```

This ensures Codex can build core components even in constrained environments. Skipping setup when not needed (e.g., code review) saves significant execution time.

-----

## AI-Specific Hints

  - The `plugins/` directory contains dynamically loaded input/output plugins
  - `contrib/` contains external contributions (e.g., plugins) that are not core-maintained
  - `statsobj.c` implements the statistics interface
  - Documentation resides in the monorepo’s doc/ directory
  - You may reference `rsyslog-docker` for dev/test environment setup
  - Side libraries are external GitHub repos, not subdirectories

  - **Shell Script Documentation**
    Use shdoc-style comments (`##`, `###`) in new and updated Bash scripts to enable automatic Markdown extraction. Many existing scripts lack these; it's **strongly recommended** to add them when modifying or creating scripts.

When generating or editing code, prefer:

  - Clean modular design
  - Compatibility and backward safety
  - Updating structured comments (e.g., Doxygen for C code)

-----

## AI Agent Commit Convention

If you are an AI agent contributing code or documentation:

  - Use the same rich commit message text as your PR description.
  - Avoid generating multiple PRs for retries — reuse and update the original PR when possible.
  - Follow the same **commit message policy** as human contributors:
      - Describe **what changed** and **why** (as far as known to the agent).
      - Note any impact on existing versions or behaviors (especially for bug fixes).
  - Commit message descriptions should clearly identify that they were generated or co-authored by an AI tool.
  - Include a **commit footer tag** like "AI-Agent: Codex"
  - **Use the canonical commit-message base prompt** to draft/lint messages (ASCII, 62/72 wrap, `<component>:` title, non-tech “why”, Impact, Before/After, full-URL Fixes/Refs):
    ai/rsyslog_commit_assistant/base_prompt.txt
  - **Commit-first:** ensure the substance is in the commit body (not only the PR). If needed, amend before opening the PR (`git commit --amend`).

-----

## Privacy, Trust & Permissions

  - AI agents **must not** push changes directly to user forks — always open PRs against `rsyslog/rsyslog`
  - Do not install third-party dependencies unless explicitly approved
  - PRs must pass standard CI and review checks
  - All code **must be reviewed manually**; AI output is subject to full review

-----

## Quickstart for AI coding agents (v8 concurrency & state)

**Read these first:**
* [`DEVELOPING.md`](./DEVELOPING.md) — v8 worker model & locking rules
* [`MODULE_AUTHOR_CHECKLIST.md`](./MODULE_AUTHOR_CHECKLIST.md) — one-screen checklist
* [doc/ai/module_map.yaml](./doc/ai/module_map.yaml) — seed list of modules, paths, and known locking needs

**Rules you must not break**
1. The framework may run **multiple workers per action**.
2. `wrkrInstanceData_t` (WID) is **per-worker**; never share it.
3. Shared mutable state lives in **pData** (per-action) and **must be protected**
   by the module (mutex/rwlock). Do **not** rely on `mutAction` for this.
4. **Inherently serial resources** (e.g., a shared stream) must be serialized
   inside the module via a mutex in **pData**.
5. **Direct queues** do not remove the need to serialize serial resources.

**Common agent tasks**
* Consult `doc/ai/module_map.yaml` to understand module paths and known locking.
* Add a “Concurrency & Locking” block at the top of output modules.
* Ensure serial modules guard stream/flush with a **pData** mutex.
* For modules with a library I/O thread (e.g., Proton), verify read/write locks
  are taken on **all** callback paths.

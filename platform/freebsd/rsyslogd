# Sample startup script for rsyslogd on FreeBSD.
# It worked on my machine, but this does not necessarily
# mean it works on all machines - it's not thouroughly
# tested. Please note that it may also work on other
# BSD variants, too.
#
# As of this writing, there was an issue with the mysql client
# library on startup. If compiled with MySQL support, rsyslogd
# would not necessarily start correctly but could eventually
# die with a "mysql client libary not found" (or similar) 
# message. I do not know its cause neither the cure. If you
# have one, let me know.
#
# ATTENTION: you need also to change the /etc/rc.config file
# and disable stock syslogd and then enable rsyslogd!

This subdirectory contains platform-specific files. They are maintained
based on a best effort basis, and are not necessarily the same like the
specific platform ships them. Some files are changed in the way the
rsyslog projects would recommend them; some may even be outdated.

Use this with care. If in doubt, please have a look at the official
distro repos. They obviously have the gold standard for each distro.

/* rsyslog.c - the main entry point into rsyslog's runtime library (RTL)
 *
 * This module contains all function which work on a RTL global level. It's
 * name is abbreviated to "rsrt" (rsyslog runtime).
 *
 * Please note that the runtime library tends to be plugin-safe. That is, it must be
 * initialized by calling a global initialization function. However, that 
 * function checks if the library is already initialized and, if so, does
 * nothing except incrementing a refeence count. Similarly, the deinit
 * function does nothing as long as there are still other users (which
 * is tracked via the refcount). As such, it is safe to call init and
 * exit multiple times, as long as this are always matching calls. This
 * capability is needed for a plugin system, where one plugin never
 * knows what the other did. HOWEVER, as of this writing, not all runtime
 * library objects may work cleanly without static global data (the
 * debug system is a very good example of this). So while we aim at the
 * ability to work well in a plugin environment, things may not really work
 * out. If you intend to use the rsyslog runtime library inside plugins,
 * you should investigate the situation in detail. Please note that the
 * rsyslog project itself does not yet need this functionality - thus you
 * can safely assume it is totally untested ;).
 *
 * rgerhards, 2008-04-17: I have now once again checked on the plugin-safety.
 * Unfortunately, there is currently no hook at all with which we could
 * abstract a global data instance class. As such, we can NOT make the
 * runtime plugin-safe in the above-described sense. As the rsyslog
 * project itself does not need this functionality (and it is quesationable
 * if someone else ever will), we do currently do not make an effort to
 * support it. So if you intend to use rsyslog runtime inside a non-rsyslog
 * plugin system, be careful!
 *
 * The rsyslog runtime library is in general reentrant and thread-safe. There
 * are some intentional exceptions (e.g. inside the msg object). These are
 * documented. Any other threading and reentrency issue can be considered a bug.

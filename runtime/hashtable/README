This is the hashtable code provided by
Christopher Clark <firstname.lastname@cl.cam.ac.uk> 
available at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cwc22/hashtable/

It may be slightly modified. The plan is to streamline
the code based on our needs and "really" integrate it into
the rsyslog runtime library. For the time being, we use it from
inside this subdirectory. We do not need all files, but I thought
I keep them together in case we later need something else.

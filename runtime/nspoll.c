/* nspoll.c
 *
 * This is an io waiter interface utilizing the much-more-efficient poll/epoll API.
 * Note that it may not always be available for a given driver. If so, that is reported
 * back to the upper peer which then should consult a nssel-based io waiter.
 * 
 * Work on this module begun 2009-11-18 by Rainer Gerhards.

 * a nspoll driver. So we simply append "sel" to the nsd driver name: This, 
 * of course, means that the driver name must match these rules, but that
 * shouldn't be a real problem.

 * netstrms.c - TODO: abstract it and move it to some common place.

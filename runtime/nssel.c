/* nssel.c
 *
 * The io waiter is a helper object enabling us to wait on a set of streams to become
 * ready for IO - this is modelled after select(). We need this, because
 * stream drivers may have different concepts. Consequently,
 * the structure must contain nsd_t's from the same stream driver type
 * only. This is implemented as a singly-linked list where every
 * new element is added at the top of the list.
 * 
 * Work on this module begun 2008-04-22 by Rainer Gerhards.

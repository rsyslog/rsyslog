Notes for Solaris

Rsyslog will be fully supported on Solaris in the future. To build it, the GNU build
tools (and most of the GNU environment) is needed. This software can be
found at the excellent http://www.blastwave.org site.

PREREQUISITES
It is strongly recommended to use GCC4 with support for
atomic instructions (if available for the platform). While rsyslog can
be built without atomic instruction support (and will work well then),
it then falls back to POSIX semaphores, which require much more CPU
time than atomic instructions. Note that even on intel platforms the
(current, as of 2010-03-25) blastwave gcc4 version targets too-old
processors by default. To change that, use "-imarch=I686" in your
CFLAGS.

CONFIGURE OPTIONS
A number of GNU tools are renamed g* so that they not conflict with
the native Solaris tools. As we need the GNU replacements, this
must be specified on the ./configure line.
Also, we must tell the linker where to find the glibc library when
building the plugins. This is done via the LDFLAGS variable as
shown below (based on the good information available at
http://prefetch.net/articles/linkers.badldlibrary.html

The working sample configure sequence I use is:

export LDFLAGS="-R/opt/csw/gcc4/lib"
./configure AR=gar ...other options...

As a "quick and dirty" fix, one may set the following library
path before executing rsyslog (may be useful to avoid recompile):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/csw/gcc4/lib

NOT YET SUPPORTED
* local log socket
* kernel log

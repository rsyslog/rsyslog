Community Resources
===================

You can also browse the following online resources:

-  the `rsyslog wiki <http://wiki.rsyslog.com/>`_, a community resource
   which includes `rsyslog configuration
   examples <http://wiki.rsyslog.com/index.php/Configuration_Samples>`_
-  `rsyslog discussion forum - use this for technical
   support <http://kb.monitorware.com/rsyslog-f40.html>`_
-  `rsyslog video tutorials <http://www.rsyslog.com/Topic8.phtml>`_
-  `rsyslog FAQ <http://www.rsyslog.com/Topic3.phtml>`_
-  `syslog device configuration
   guide <http://www.monitorware.com/en/syslog-enabled-products/>`_
   (off-site)
-  `deutsches rsyslog
   forum <http://kb.monitorware.com/rsyslog-f49.html>`_ (forum in German
   language)

And don't forget about the `rsyslog mailing
list <http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog>`_. If you are
interested in the "backstage", you may find
`Rainer <http://www.gerhards.net/rainer>`_'s
`blog <http://blog.gerhards.net/>`_ an interesting read (filter on
syslog and rsyslog tags). Or meet `Rainer Gerhards at
Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/people/Rainer-Gerhards/1349393098>`_
or `Google+ <https://plus.google.com/112402185904751517878/posts>`_. If
you would like to use rsyslog source code inside your open source
project, you can do that without any restriction as long as your license
is GPLv3 compatible. If your license is incompatible to GPLv3, you may
even be still permitted to use rsyslog source code. However, then you
need to look at the way `rsyslog is licensed <licensing.html>`_.

Feedback is always welcome, but if you have a support question, please
do not mail Rainer directly (`why not? <free_support.html>`_) - use the
`rsyslog mailing
list <http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog>`_ or `rsyslog
forum <http://kb.monitorware.com/rsyslog-f40.html>`_ instead.

Contributor Hall of Fame
------------------------

**This page is dedicated to all the people who helped make
`rsyslog <http://www.rsyslog.com/>`_ become a reality.** Unfortunately,
I have begun this page in July of 2007, long after the project started.
I try to extract all past contributor information from CVS, readme's,
code etc - but I may fail. If you contributed and do not find yourself
listed below, please accept my sincere apologies and drop me a line.

Please also note that I will do the checks for past contributors once
the current very busy development phase is over, so it may take a few
weeks to fully populate this file.

Contributors are listed in alphabetical order. If I know an Alias only,
that alias is used as heading. Else the real name is used. If I know
first and last name, they are listed in that order ("Rainer Gerhards"
and not "Gerhards, Rainer"). I tend to be sparse with information on
contributors, at least without their permission. If you contribute, let
me know if I may include your email and/or web page address.

Thanks to all past, present and future contributors!

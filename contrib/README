This directory contains a number of possibly useful things that do not
directly relate to rsyslog. They are not actively supported, but as
I said often helpful. Use them with some care, as they may be outdated
in respect to the current release of rsyslog.

At least some of this stuff has been found by our users and been
included after a brief check and possibly an adaptation. If you have
something useful you would like to see in contrib, just drop us a 
note (see https://www.rsyslog.com for how to do that at the time your
are reading this document).

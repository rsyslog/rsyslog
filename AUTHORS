Thankfully, we have had so many contributions that maintaining the
AUTHORS file would be a big task in itself. On the other hand, we
now use git and I make sure that each author receives proper credit
for patches I receive.

So rather than trying to reproduce the git author log here (and
often making mistakes in that), I invite you to check the git logs.

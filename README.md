# Rsyslog - What is it?

[![Help Contribute to Open Source](https://www.codetriage.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rsyslog/rsyslog)

**Rsyslog** is a **r**ocket-fast **sys**tem for **log** processing.

It offers high-performance, advanced security features, and a modular design.
Originally a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a highly versatile logging solution capable of ingesting data from numerous sources, transforming it, and outputting it to a wide variety of destinations.

Rsyslog can deliver over one million messages per second to local destinations under minimal processing (based on v7, Dec 2013). Even with complex routing and remote forwarding, performance remains excellent.

## Installation

### Via Distribution Package Managers
Rsyslog is available in the package repositories of most Linux distributions. On non-systemd systems (e.g., Ubuntu), rsyslog is often pre-installed.

### Project-Provided Packages (for latest versions)
Distributions often lag behind in packaging the latest rsyslog releases. Official builds for newer versions are available here:

- [RPM-based systems](https://www.rsyslog.com/rhelcentos-rpms/)
- [Ubuntu](https://www.rsyslog.com/ubuntu-repository/)
- [Debian](https://www.rsyslog.com/debian-repository/)

### Building from Source
See: [Build Instructions](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/installation/build_from_repo.html)

#### Build Environment Requirements
- `pkg-config`
- `libestr`
- `liblogging` (stdlog component, for testbench)

Build support libraries from source if you're working with the latest git master.

#### OS-specific Build Instructions
Refer to the respective section in the original README for required packages on CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, etc.

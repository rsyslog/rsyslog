# Rsyslog – What Is It?

**Rsyslog** is a **r**ocket-fast **sys**tem for **log** processing pipelines.

It offers high performance, advanced security features, and a modular design.  
Originally a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a highly versatile logging solution capable of ingesting data from numerous sources, transforming it, and outputting it to a wide variety of destinations.

Rsyslog can deliver over one million messages per second to local destinations under minimal processing (based on v7, Dec 2013). Even with complex routing and remote forwarding, performance remains excellent.

## Installation

### Via Distribution Package Managers
Rsyslog is available in most Linux distribution repositories and often is pre-installed. 

### Project-Provided Packages (Latest Versions)
Distributions may lag behind in packaging the latest rsyslog releases.  
Official builds for newer versions are available here:

* [RPM-based systems](https://rsyslog.com/rhelcentos-rpms/)  
* [Ubuntu](https://rsyslog.com/ubuntu-repository/)  
* [Debian](https://rsyslog.com/debian-repository/)  
* [Official Containers](packaging/docker/README.md)

For users in regions where GitHub access is limited, see the  
[Global Accessibility and Collaboration](#global-accessibility-and-collaboration) section for alternative mirrors.

<details>
<summary><strong>Building from Source (click to expand)</strong></summary>

See: [Build Instructions](https://rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/installation/build_from_repo.html)

#### Build Environment Requirements
* `pkg-config`  
* `libestr`  
* `liblogging` (stdlog component, for testbench)

Build support libraries from source if you're working with the latest git master.

#### Branch Guidance
The `master` branch tracks active development.  
For production use, prefer the latest tagged release.

#### OS-Specific Build Instructions
Refer to the respective section in the original README for required packages on CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, etc.

#### Development Containers & Testing
Ready-to-use build environments are provided in `packaging/docker/dev_env`.  
These images were previously built in the separate [rsyslog-docker](https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog-docker) repository and are now maintained here.  
See `packaging/docker/README.md` for details.

Runtime container definitions are in `packaging/docker/rsyslog`.  
Run the test suite inside the container with:

```bash
make check -j4
```

### AI-Based Code Review (Experimental)

We are currently testing AI-based code review for pull requests.  
At this time, we use **Google Gemini** to automatically analyze code and provide comments on new PRs.

* Reviews are **informational only**  
* Every contribution is still **manually reviewed** by human experts  
* The goal is to evaluate how AI can support contributor feedback and code quality assurance

Please report any issues, false positives, or suggestions about the AI review process.

## Project Philosophy

Rsyslog development is driven by real-world use cases, open standards, and an active community.  
While sponsored primarily by Adiscon, technical decisions are made independently via consensus.

All contributors are welcome — there is no formal membership beyond participation.

---

## Global Accessibility and Collaboration

Rsyslog aims to remain accessible worldwide. Different regions sometimes face network or platform limits, so we provide mirrors to ensure that everyone can obtain the source code and contribute on equal terms.

- **GitHub (canonical):** https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog  
- **European mirror (Germany, hosted on DigitalOcean):** http://github-mirror.rsyslog.com/rsyslog/rsyslog  
- **Community mirror (China, maintained by Gitee):** https://gitee.com/mirrors_rsyslog  

All pull requests ultimately flow through GitHub, where our CI and review infrastructure run.  
If you experience access issues but can provide a patch, the rsyslog team will gladly assist in forwarding it to GitHub.  
Our contribution workflow remains GitHub-based for now because CI and automated testing are tightly integrated there.  
Always verify releases and tags from the official GitHub repository before production use.

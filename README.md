rsyslog-docs (master)
========================

Documentation for the rsyslog project
-------------------------------------

This is a work in progress. We are currently migrating over to a new document
generation framework.

The process of this work will be done as follows:

# Complete v5-stable documentation
# Merge v5-stable into v7-stable branch
# Update v7-stable branch with all new documentation and materials specific for that version
# Repeat 2 and 3 merging current repo with next highest until Master is merged and updated.

Current Status -
* **_v5-stable_**
* v7-stable
* v7-devel
* v8-devel

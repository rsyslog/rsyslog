# Transactional reload implementation and PR-stack ledger

Recorded: 2026-10-15. Status: stack construction in progress; umbrella rebase
published, individual stack PRs not yet published.
Umbrella: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/7654 (draft).

## Method and merge contract

- Use durable sibling worktrees; never depend on /tmp for work or evidence.
- Split by complete functionality and ownership invariant, not patch size alone.
- Each PR targets its immediate predecessor; merge strictly in numbered order.
  After its predecessor merges, retarget the next PR to main and verify that
  its reviewed delta is unchanged. Never merge a child before its parent.
- Fold follow-up fixes and their regression tests into the PR introducing the
  affected capability. Preserve SPDX/provenance; all new files use Apache-2.0.
- A candidate split is not accepted until it builds, its focused tests pass,
  and unsupported changes fail closed. No intermediate PR may expose known
  unsafe listener topology support that a later PR happens to repair.
- Keep each security delta within the bounded review lane; split again if a
  coherent unit exceeds it. Review with independent Luna/high roles.
- Preserve combined content with a final tree comparison against the rebased,
  hardened umbrella. Explain every intentional difference in this ledger.
- Every PR description must link parent, child, umbrella, and full merge order;
  state newly supported behavior, retained restrictions, and actual validation.
  Do not carry final-branch capability claims into an earlier stack member.

## Implementation inventory at the umbrella checkpoint

These rows locate implemented code; they do not claim it has merged to main.

| Area | Implementation | Evidence / current limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module lifecycle and graph reports | runtime/module-reload.c, runtime/modules.h, runtime/reload-normalized-graph.*, runtime/reload-report.* | Module/report/graph units; conservative missing-hook classification |
| Candidate loading and source identity | runtime/reload-candidate.*, runtime/reload-ruleset-graph.*, runtime/rsconf.*, grammar/parserif.h, runtime/yamlconf.* | RS/YAML parity and candidate graph tests; private loading rather than full reinitialization |
| Ruleset cloning and activation | grammar/reload-syntax-clone.c, grammar/reload-ruleset-materializer.*, runtime/ruleset.*, runtime/action.c | Clone/materializer tests; bounded bodies and unchanged named actions, no general call/action lifecycle |
| Queue and worker quiescence | runtime/queue-barrier.c, runtime/wtp-quiesce.c, runtime/wti.c, runtime/wtp.c | Worker units and closed-dequeue-window integration; keep pre-wait and idle rechecks |
| Existing TCP listener policy | plugins/imtcp/imtcp.c, runtime/tcpsrv.*, runtime/tcps_sess.* | RS/YAML ruleset, ACL, capacity, rate-limit and profile tests; accept-time profiles remain frozen |
| Prepared TCP endpoint lifecycle | runtime/tcpsrv-prepared.h, runtime/tcpsrv-poll.h, plugins/imtcp/imtcp-lifecycle.h | Production backend/lifecycle units and add/retire/replace tests; bounded plain TCP only |
| Coordinator and retirement | tools/shadow_reload.*, tools/rsyslogd.c | Main-loop pending cleanup retry; failed resume retains ownership and cannot retroactively reject published state |
| Global scalar policy | runtime/glbl.*, runtime/parser_sanitize_helper.h, runtime/msg_programname_helper.h | Parser/global RS/YAML tests; only one supported changed scalar per candidate |
| Operator documentation | doc/source/development/transactional_config_reload.rst, doc/source/rainerscript/global.rst, doc/source/configuration/modules/imtcp.rst | Distinguishes supported subset from future roadmap |
| Performance harness | benchmarks/imtcp-ruleset-reload/ | Existing validate-mode harness is not on-mode activation acceptance |

## Proposed functional merge order

All rows remain **planned** until the adjusted boundary is validated and a PR
URL/head/base is entered. Historical cut points are reconstruction aids, not
an assertion that those intermediate revisions are safe to merge unchanged.

| Order | Boundary | Historical endpoint | Required adjustments before publication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Opt-in HUP policy foundation and diagnostics | 4cec00ed2 | Keep activation unsupported; distinguish benchmark tooling from acceptance |
| 2 | Deterministic reports and owned active graph | 6cd550a92 | Fold applicable graph ownership/error fixes |
| 3 | Side-effect-free candidate loading and source report | 4b19f5e2c | Preserve source isolation and fail-closed activation boundary |
| 4 | Queue barrier and owned existing-ruleset activation | 5b4bb32b4 | Fold selector identity/cache and worker quiescence merge-resolution fixes and tests |
| 5 | Detached imtcp candidate and endpoint ownership | fc0ab37b0 | No live topology publication; preserve effective-value classification |
| 6 | Compatible live policy and accept-time session profiles | df572f55d | Fold resume-error ownership/retry handling before exposing failing resume paths |
| 7 | Runtime reconciliation/retirement and rate-limit base | 1494de8ba | Gate unsafe topology before prepare until bounded lifecycle PR 12 |
| 8 | Capacity, sender ACLs and helper failure contracts | eb2f4d101 | Include denied-session reclamation in the ACL-introducing PR |
| 9 | Simple named rate-limit policy lifecycle | 1a6c3daa8 | Retain source ownership and sharing restrictions |
| 10 | Global/parser policy subset | 60dbf92ca | Move unrelated child-exit/scalar work here where practical; retain one-scalar rule |
| 11 | Remaining scalar profiles and coherent sampling | b2e01e773 | Fold parser helper/sampling fixes into earliest dependent scalar PR |
| 12 | Bounded prepared TCP add/remove/replace | 0d85d74e3 | Include poll capacity, readiness, startup serialization, diagnostics and docs together |

## Current evidence and remaining work

Published umbrella head before rebase: 75f8c832cb6901f0b642cad878b393fec858815b.
Backup: codex/reload-before-rebase-20261015.
Rebase base: 62ab7a35ff8dfe0fd572c6a39853b2b32d9b9e8f.
Local rebased head before folded fixes: 0d85d74e3.

Historical merge 7ef92ae48 carried nontrivial resolutions. Linear rebase omitted
some of them; restored small deltas cover selector identity/fingerprints,
cache reset, grammar cleanup, idle/quiesce checks, and their regression tests.
The upstream zero-length parser guard is retained in the extracted helper.

Post-rebase focused container run: 18 passed, zero skips/failures/errors,
including module resume helper, restored selector and closed-window tests,
production TCP backend and both replacement frontends. This is targeted
evidence, not fresh full-branch clearance. Independent Luna/high integration
review found no remaining concrete defect in the reviewed restoration/fix.

Durable local evidence: .codex/security-review/rebase-20261015.md,
rebase-range-diff.log, original-merge-resolution.patch,
rebase-focused-restored.log and rebase-format-final.log.

Rebased umbrella c779824606fb8095c48e52c5ee6f933d72301043 was published with
an explicit lease against the old head; GitHub reports mergeable. Fresh broad
Ubuntu 26.04 evidence: 1,667 passes, 70 skips, zero failures/errors (863.94s).
Production analyzer: no bugs (267.35s). The recorder sealed the actual source
commit and original Automake summary; no publication override was needed.
Current whole-branch security package has 172 reviewable files and 25,406
changed reviewable lines: needs_human, to be replaced by per-slice review.

## Prepared stack checkpoints (not published PRs)

| Slice | Branch / current checkpoint | Functional checks | Review and other evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | codex/reload-stack-01-foundation, 0f259088d | No-systemd build; 8/8 policy/unit tests | Fresh independent Luna/high discovery and lead passed; analyzer clean; mock distcheck, HTML and extended docs distribution passed |
| 2 | codex/reload-stack-02-reports, 589658d1c | 7/7 report/graph/frontend checks; both field-omission negative controls fail, restored control passes | Independent discovery has no security candidate; lead pending; mock distribution passed |
| 3 | codex/reload-stack-03-candidates, 5cc3d0f6c | 10/10 candidate/graph/frontend/error checks | Independent security and distribution/docs gates pending |
| 4 | codex/reload-stack-04-ruleset-activation, 0fb1e65db | 12/12 clone/barrier/worker/activation checks | Independent security, sanitizer and distribution/docs gates pending |

These head IDs are reconstruction checkpoints, not permanent PR identities;
later folded fixes may change them. Each branch is based on its preceding
slice, not independently on main. Never infer merge readiness from the table
alone. Published PR links and verified bases must replace these placeholders.

Boundary adjustments already made: benchmark assets are absent from the first
three slices, retained in the umbrella for later performance/tooling work.
Unrelated disk-queue checkpoint-residue maintenance is excluded from slice 2,
retained in the umbrella, and needs a separate test-maintenance boundary.
The early graph producer is source-spelling-sensitive: case-only names can be
reported more strictly than runtime's case-insensitive ruleset lookup. This is
a conservative report limitation, not a security finding or semantic-equivalence
claim; expose the restriction in the affected PR's support statement.

Open work: construct and validate each adjusted stack boundary, record PR URLs
and exact source/image evidence, review security per slice, and complete the
activation-mode release-performance gate. Only then begin milestone 4 (general
ruleset graph/call lifecycle). Current bounded reload is not full-config reload.

RainerScript
============

**RainerScript is a scripting language specifically designed and
well-suited for processing network events and configuring event
processors.**
It is the prime configuration language used for rsyslog.
Please note that RainerScript may not be abbreviated as rscript,
because that's somebody else's trademark.

Some limited RainerScript support is available since rsyslog 3.12.0
(for expression support). In v5, "if .. then" statements are supported.
The first full implementation is available since rsyslog v6.

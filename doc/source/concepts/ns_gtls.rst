gtls Network Stream Driver
==========================

This network stream driver implements a TLS
protected transport via the `GnuTLS
library <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/>`_.

**Available since:** 3.19.0 (suggested minimum 3.19.8 and above)

Supported Driver Modes
======================

-  **0** - unencrypted transmission (just like `ptcp <ns_ptcp.html>`_ driver)
-  **1** - TLS-protected operation

.. note::

   Mode 0 does not provide any benefit over the ptcp driver. This
   mode exists for technical reasons, but should not be used. It may be
   removed in the future.

Supported Authentication Modes
==============================

-  **anon** - anonymous authentication as described in IETF's
   draft-ietf-syslog-transport-tls-12 Internet draft

-  **x509/fingerprint** - certificate fingerprint authentication as
   described in IETF's draft-ietf-syslog-transport-tls-12 Internet draft.
   The fingerprint must be provided as the SHA1 or the SHA256 hex string of
   the certificate. Multiple values must be separated by comma (,).
   A valid configuration would be e.g.
   ::

      StreamDriverPermittedPeers="SHA256:10:C4:26:1D:CB:3C:AB:12:DB:1A:F0:47:37:AE:6D:D2:DE:66:B5:71:B7:2E:5B:BB:AE:0C:7E:7F:5F:0D:E9:64,SHA1:DD:23:E3:E7:70:F5:B4:13:44:16:78:A5:5A:8C:39:48:53:A6:DD:25"

-  **x509/certvalid** - certificate validation only

-  **x509/name** - certificate validation and subject name authentication as
   described in IETF's draft-ietf-syslog-transport-tls-12 Internet draft

.. note::

   "anon" does not permit to authenticate the remote peer. As such,
   this mode is vulnerable to man in the middle attacks as well as
   unauthorized access. It is recommended NOT to use this mode.
   A certificate/key does not need to be configured in this authmode.

.. note::

   **Anon mode changes in:** v8.190 (or above)

   -  Anonymous Ciphers (DH and ECDH) are available in ANON mode.
	Note: ECDH is not available on GnuTLS Version below 3.x.
   -  Server does not require a certificate anymore in anon mode.
   -  If Server has a certificate and the Client does not, the highest possible
      ciphers will be selected.
   -  If both Server and Client do not have a certificate, the highest available
      anon cipher will be used.

x509/certvalid is a non-standard mode. It validates the remote peers
certificate, but does not check the subject name. This is weak
authentication that may be useful in scenarios where multiple devices
are deployed and it is sufficient proof of authenticity when their
certificates are signed by the CA the server trusts. This is better than
anon authentication, but still not recommended. **Known Problems**


CheckExtendedKeyPurpose
=======================

-  **off** - by default this binary argument is turned off, which means
   that Extended Key Usage extension of GNUTls certificates is ignored 
   in cert validation.

-  **on** - if you turn this option on, it will check that peer's certificate
   contains the value for GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER or GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_CLIENT
   respectively, depending whether we are on the sending or the receiving end of a
   connection. 

PrioritizeSAN
=============

-  **off** - by default this binary argument is turned off, which means
   that validation of names in certificates goes per older RFC 5280 and either
   Subject Alternative Name or Common Name match is good and connection is
   allowed.

-  **on** - if you turn this option on, it will perform stricter name checking
   as per newer RFC 6125, where, if any SAN is found, contents of CN are 
   completely ignored and name validity is decided based on SAN only.

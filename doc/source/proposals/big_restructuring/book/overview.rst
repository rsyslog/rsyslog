Write a bit about the logging challenge.

What is Rsyslog?
----------------

`Rsyslog <http://www.rsyslog.com/>`_ is a **r**\ ocket-fast **sys**\ tem for **log** processing.
It offers high-performance, great security features and a modular design.
While it started as a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a kind of
**swiss army knife of logging**, being able to

- accept inputs from a wide variety of sources,
- transform them,
- and output the results to diverse destinations.

Rsyslog has a strong enterprise focus but also scales down to small
systems.

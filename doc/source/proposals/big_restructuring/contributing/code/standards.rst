Coding Standards
================

When contributing code to Rsyslog, you must follow its coding standards. To
make a long story short, here is the golden rule: **Imitate the existing
Rsyslog code**. Most open-source modules and libraries recommended by Rsyslog also
follow the same guidelines, and you should too.

Remember that the main advantage of standards is that every piece of code
looks and feels familiar, it's not about this or that being more readable.

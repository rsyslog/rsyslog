How you can Help
----------------

**You like rsyslog and would like to lend us a helping hand?** This page
tells you how easy it is to help a little bit. You can contribute to the
project even with a single mouse click! If you could pick a single item
from the wish list, that would be awfully helpful!

This is our wish list:

-  let others know how great rsyslog is

   -  spread word about rsyslog in forums and newsgroups
   -  place a link to `www.rsyslog.com <http://www.rsyslog.com>`_ from
      your home page

-  let us know about rsyslog - we are eager for feedback

   -  tell us what you like and what you not like - so that we can
      include that into development
   -  tell us what you use rsyslog for - especially if you have high
      traffic volume or an otherwise "uncommon" deployment. We are
      looking for case studies and experience how rsyslog performs in
      unusual scenarios.
   -  allow us to post your thoughts and experiences as a "user story"
      on the web site (so far, none are there ;))

-  if you know how to create packages (rpm, deb, ...)

   -  we would very much appreciate your help with package creation. We
      know that it is important to have good binary packages for a
      product to spread widely. Yet, we do not have the knowledge to do
      it all ourselves. `Drop Rainer a
      note <mailto:rgerhards@adiscon.com>`_\ if you could help us out.

-  if you have configured a device for sending syslog data, and that
   device is not in our `syslog configuration
   database <https://www.adiscon.com/syslog-enabled-products/#>`_,
   you might want to tell us how to configure it.
-  if you are a corporate user

   -  you might consider `Adiscon <http://www.adiscon.com>`_'s
      commercial `MonitorWare products <http://www.monitorware.com/>`_
      for Windows, e.g. to deliver Windows Event Log data to rsyslogd
      (sales of the commercial products funds the open source
      development - and they also work very well).
   -  you might be interested in `purchasing professional support or
      add-on
      development <http://www.adiscon.com/Common/en/Products/techsup.php>`_
      for rsyslog

**We appreciate your help very much.** A big thank you for anything you
might do!

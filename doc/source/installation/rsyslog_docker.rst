Using Rsyslog Docker Containers
===============================

The rsyslog project provides a ready-to-run "syslog appliance" which provides
all rsyslog features in an easy to use way. To run it, simply do

|DockerApplianceAlpineRun|

Up-to-date information on how to use this container can be found at the
|DockerApplianceAlpineDockerHubRepo|_.

.. warning::

   The docker containers are currently (early 2018) under development
   and must be used with some care.

Further Information
-------------------
The rsyslog project also provides a number of additional containers for
different needs (end users, developers, package builders, ...). A full
overview of what is currently available can be found at the |RsyslogDockerHub|_.
Source code for the docker containers is kept in Github at
|GitHubDockerProject|_.

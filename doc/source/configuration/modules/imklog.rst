imklog: Kernel Log Input Module
*******************************

===========================  ===========================================================================
**Module Name:**             **imklog**
**Author:**                  `Rainer Gerhards <https://rainer.gerhards.net/>`_ <rgerhards@adiscon.com>
===========================  ===========================================================================


Purpose
=======

Reads messages from the kernel log and submits them to the syslog
engine.


Configuration Parameters
========================

.. note::

   Parameter names are case-insensitive.


Module Parameters
-----------------

InternalMsgFacility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "facility", "(see description)", "no", "``$KLogInternalMsgFacility``"

The facility which messages internally generated by imklog will
have. imklog generates some messages of itself (e.g. on problems,
startup and shutdown) and these do not stem from the kernel.
Historically, under Linux, these too have "kern" facility. Thus, on
Linux platforms the default is "kern" while on others it is
"syslogd". You usually do not need to specify this configuration
directive - it is included primarily for few limited cases where it
is needed for good reason. Bottom line: if you don't have a good idea
why you should use this setting, do not touch it.


PermitNonKernelFacility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "binary", "off", "no", "``$KLogPermitNonKernelFacility``"

At least under BSD the kernel log may contain entries with
non-kernel facilities. This setting controls how those are handled.
The default is "off", in which case these messages are ignored.
Switch it to on to submit non-kernel messages to rsyslog processing.


ConsoleLogLevel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "integer", "-1", "no", "``$klogConsoleLogLevel``"

Sets the console log level. If specified, only messages with up to
the specified level are printed to the console. The default is -1,
which means that the current settings are not modified. To get this
behavior, do not specify $klogConsoleLogLevel in the configuration
file. Note that this is a global parameter. Each time it is changed,
the previous definition is re-set. The one activate will be that one
that is active when imklog actually starts processing. In short
words: do not specify this directive more than once!

**Linux only**, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified)


ParseKernelTimestamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "binary", "off", "no", "``$klogParseKernelTimestamp``"

If enabled and the kernel creates a timestamp for its log messages,
this timestamp will be parsed and converted into regular message time
instead to use the receive time of the kernel message (as in 5.8.x
and before). Default is 'off' to prevent parsing the kernel timestamp,
because the clock used by the kernel to create the timestamps is not
supposed to be as accurate as the monotonic clock required to convert
it. Depending on the hardware and kernel, it can result in message
time differences between kernel and system messages which occurred at
same time.


KeepKernelTimestamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "binary", "off", "no", "``$klogKeepKernelTimestamp``"

If enabled, this option causes to keep the [timestamp] provided by
the kernel at the begin of in each message rather than to remove it,
when it could be parsed and converted into local time for use as
regular message time. Only used, when $klogParseKernelTimestamp is
on.


LogPath
^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "word", "(see description)", "no", "``$klogpath``"

Defines the path to the log file that is used.
If this parameter is not set a default will be used.
On Linux "/proc/kmsg" and else "/dev/klog".


RatelimitInterval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "integer", "0", "no", "none"

.. versionadded:: 8.35.0

The rate-limiting interval in seconds. Value 0 turns off rate limiting.
Set it to a number of seconds (5 recommended) to activate rate-limiting.


RatelimitBurst
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "type", "default", "mandatory", "|FmtObsoleteName| directive"
   :widths: auto
   :class: parameter-table

   "integer", "10000", "no", "none"

.. versionadded:: 8.35.0

Specifies the rate-limiting burst in number of messages.  Set it high to
preserve all boot-up messages.


Caveats/Known Bugs
==================

This is obviously platform specific and requires platform drivers.
Currently, imklog functionality is available on Linux and BSD.

This module is **not supported on Solaris** and not needed there. For
Solaris kernel input, use :doc:`imsolaris <imsolaris>`.


Example 1
=========

The following sample pulls messages from the kernel log. All parameters
are left by default, which is usually a good idea. Please note that
loading the plugin is sufficient to activate it. No directive is needed
to start pulling kernel messages.

.. code-block:: none

   module(load="imklog")


Example 2
=========

The following sample adds a ratelimiter.  The burst and interval are
set high to allow for a large volume of messages on boot.

.. code-block:: none

  module(load="imklog" RatelimitBurst="5000" RatelimitInterval="5")


Unsupported |FmtObsoleteName| directives
========================================

.. function:: $DebugPrintKernelSymbols on/off

   Linux only, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified).
   Defaults to off.

.. function:: $klogLocalIPIF

   This directive is no longer supported. Instead, use the global
   $localHostIPIF directive instead.


.. function:: $klogUseSyscallInterface on/off

   Linux only, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified).
   Defaults to off.

.. function:: $klogSymbolsTwice on/off

   Linux only, ignored on other platforms (but may be specified).
   Defaults to off.

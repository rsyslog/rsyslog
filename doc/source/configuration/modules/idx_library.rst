Library Modules
===============

Library modules provide dynamically loadable functionality for parts of
rsyslog, most often for other loadable modules. They can not be
user-configured and are loaded automatically by some components. They
are just mentioned so that error messages that point to library modules
can be understood. No module list is provided.

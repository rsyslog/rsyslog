Legacy Directives affecting Input Modules
=========================================

Legacy Directives affecting multiple Input Modules
--------------------------------------------------
While these directives only affect input modules, they are global in
the sense that they cannot be overwritten for specific input
instances. So they apply globally for all inputs that support these
directives.

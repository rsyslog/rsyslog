TLS.AuthMode
============

.. index::
   single: imrelp; TLS.AuthMode
   single: TLS.AuthMode

.. summary-start

Selects the mutual authentication strategy for TLS-secured RELP sessions.

.. summary-end

This parameter applies to :doc:`../../configuration/modules/imrelp`.

:Name: TLS.AuthMode
:Scope: input
:Type: string
:Default: input=none
:Required?: no
:Introduced: Not documented

Description
-----------
Sets the mode used for mutual authentication.

Supported values are either "*fingerprint*\ " or "*name"*.

Fingerprint mode basically is what SSH does. It does not require a full PKI to
be present, instead self-signed certs can be used on all peers. Even if a CA
certificate is given, the validity of the peer cert is NOT verified against it.
Only the certificate fingerprint counts.

In "name" mode, certificate validation happens. Here, the matching is done
against the certificate's subjectAltName and, as a fallback, the subject common
name. If the certificate contains multiple names, a match on any one of these
names is considered good and permits the peer to talk to rsyslog.

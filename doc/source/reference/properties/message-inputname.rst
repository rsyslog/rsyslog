=========

   single: inputname

.. summary-start

Identifies the rsyslog input module instance that produced the message.

.. summary-end

This property belongs to the **Message Properties** group.

:Name: inputname
:Category: Message Properties
:Type: string

Description
-----------
The name of the input module that generated the message (e.g. "imuxsock",
"imudp"). Note that not all modules necessarily provide this property. If not
provided, it is an empty string. Also note that the input module may provide any
value of its liking. Most importantly, it is **not** necessarily the module
input name. Internal sources can also provide inputnames. Currently, "rsyslogd"
is defined as inputname for messages internally generated by rsyslogd, for
example startup and shutdown and error messages. This property is considered
useful when trying to filter messages based on where they originated - e.g.
locally generated messages ("rsyslogd", "imuxsock", "imklog") should go to a
different place than messages generated somewhere else.

Usage
-----

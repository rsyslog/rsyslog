Setting up the CA
=================

The first step is to set up a certificate authority (CA). It must be
maintained by a trustworthy person (or group) and approves the
identities of all machines. It does so by issuing their certificates.
In a small setup, the administrator can provide the CA function. What is
important is the CA's private key is well-protected and machine 
certificates are only issued if it is know they are valid (in a 
single-admin case that means the admin should not issue certificates to 
anyone else except himself).

The CA creates a so-called self-signed certificate. That is, it approves
its own authenticity. This sounds useless, but the key point to understand
is that every machine will be provided a copy of the CA's certificate.
Accepting this certificate is a matter of trust. So by configuring the
CA certificate, the administrator tells
`rsyslog <http://www.rsyslog.com>`_ which certificates to trust. This is
the root of all trust under this model. That is why the CA's private key
is so important - everyone getting hold of it is trusted by our rsyslog
instances.

To create a self-signed certificate, use the following commands with
GnuTLS (which is currently the only supported TLS library, what may
change in the future). Please note that GnuTLS' tools are not installed
by default on many platforms. Also, the tools do not necessarily come
with the GnuTLS core package. If you do not have certtool on your
system, check if there is package for the GnuTLS tools available (under
Fedora, for example, this is named gnutls-utils-<version> and it is NOT
installed by default).

#. generate the private key:

   ::

       certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem

   This takes a short while. Be sure to do some work on your
   workstation, it waits for random input. Switching between windows is
   sufficient ;)
   

#. now create the (self-signed) CA certificate itself:

   ::

       certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem --outfile ca.pem

   This generates the CA certificate. This command queries you for a
   number of things. Use appropriate responses. When it comes to
   certificate validity, keep in mind that you need to recreate all
   certificates when this one expires. So it may be a good idea to use a
   long period, eg. 3650 days (roughly 10 years). You need to specify
   that the certificates belongs to an authority. The certificate is
   used to sign other certificates.

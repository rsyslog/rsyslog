<p>This is a part of the rsyslog.conf documentation.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>The action field of a rule describes what to do with the
message. In general, message content is written to a kind of "logfile".
But also other actions might be done, like writing to a database table
or forwarding to another host.<br>
<br>
Templates can be used with all actions. If used, the specified template
is used to generate the message content (instead of the default
template). To specify a template, write a semicolon after the action
value immediately followed by the template name.<br>
<br>
Beware: templates MUST be defined BEFORE they are used. It is OK to
define some templates, then use them in selector lines, define more
templates and use use them in the following selector lines. But it is
NOT permitted to use a template in a selector line that is above its
definition. If you do this, the action will be ignored.</p>
<p><b>You can have multiple actions for a single selector </b>&nbsp;(or
more precisely a single filter of such a selector line). Each action
must be on its own line and the line must start with an ampersand
('&amp;') character and have no filters. An example would be</p>
<p><code><b>*.=crit :omusrmsg:rger<br>
&amp; root<br>
&amp; /var/log/critmsgs</b></code></p>
<p>These three lines send critical messages to the user rger and
root and also store them in /var/log/critmsgs. <b>Using multiple
actions per selector is</b> convenient and also <b>offers
a performance benefit</b>. As the filter needs to be evaluated
only once, there is less computation required to process the directive
compared to the otherwise-equal config directives below:</p>
<p><code><b>*.=crit :omusrmsg:rger<br>
*.=crit root<br>
*.=crit /var/log/critmsgs</b></code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Regular File</h3>
<p>Typically messages are logged to real files. The file usually is
specified by full pathname, beginning with a slash "/".
Starting with version 4.6.2 and 5.4.1 (previous v5 version do NOT support this)
relative file names can also be specified. To do so, these must begin with a
dot. For example, use "./file-in-current-dir.log" to specify a file in the
current directory. Please note that rsyslogd usually changes its working 
directory to the root, so relative file names must be tested with care (they
were introduced primarily as a debugging vehicle, but may have useful other applications
as well).<br>
<br>
<br>
You may prefix each entry with the minus "-'' sign to omit syncing the
file after every logging. Note that you might lose information if the
system crashes right behind a write attempt. Nevertheless this might
give you back some performance, especially if you run programs that use
logging in a very verbose manner.</p>
<p>If your system is connected to a reliable UPS and you receive
lots of log data (e.g. firewall logs), it might be a very good idea to
turn of
syncing by specifying the "-" in front of the file name. </p>
<p><b>The filename can be either static </b>(always
the same) or <b>dynamic</b> (different based on message
received). The later is useful if you would automatically split
messages into different files based on some message criteria. For
example, dynamic file name selectors allow you to split messages into
different files based on the host that sent them. With dynamic file
names, everything is automatic and you do not need any filters. </p>
<p>It works via the template system. First, you define a template
for the file name. An example can be seen above in the description of
template. We will use the "DynFile" template defined there. Dynamic
filenames are indicated by specifying a questions mark "?" instead of a
slash, followed by the template name. Thus, the selector line for our
dynamic file name would look as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>*.* ?DynFile</code>
</blockquote>
<p>That's all you need to do. Rsyslog will now automatically
generate file names for you and store the right messages into the right
files. Please note that the minus sign also works with dynamic file
name selectors. Thus, to avoid syncing, you may use</p>
<blockquote>
<code>*.* -?DynFile</code></blockquote>
<p>And of course you can use templates to specify the output
format:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>*.* ?DynFile;MyTemplate</code></blockquote>
<p><b>A word of caution:</b> rsyslog creates files as
needed. So if a new host is using your syslog server, rsyslog will
automatically create a new file for it.</p>
<p><b>Creating directories is also supported</b>. For
example you can use the hostname as directory and the program name as
file name:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>$template DynFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/%programname%.log"</code></blockquote>
<h3>Named Pipes</h3>
<p>This version of rsyslogd(8) has support for logging output to
named pipes (fifos). A fifo or named pipe can be used as a destination
for log messages by prepending a pipe symbol ("|'') to the name of the
file. This is handy for debugging. Note that the fifo must be created
with the mkfifo(1) command before rsyslogd(8) is started.</p>
<h3>Terminal and Console</h3>
<p>If the file you specified is a tty, special tty-handling is
done, same with /dev/console.</p>
<h3>Remote Machine</h3>
<p>Rsyslogd provides full remote logging, i.e. is able to send
messages to a remote host running rsyslogd(8) and to receive messages
from remote hosts. Using this feature you're able to control all syslog
messages on one host, if all other machines will log remotely to that.
This tears down administration needs.</p>
<p>To forward messages to another host, prepend the hostname with
the at sign ("@"). A single at sign means that messages will
be forwarded via UDP protocol (the standard for syslog). If you prepend
two at signs ("@@"), the messages will be transmitted via TCP. Please
note that plain TCP based syslog is not officially standardized, but
most major syslogds support it (e.g. syslog-ng or
<a href="http://www.winsyslog.com/">WinSyslog</a>). The
forwarding action indicator (at-sign) can be followed by one or more
options. If they are given, they must be immediately (without a space)
following the final at sign and be enclosed in parenthesis. The
individual options must be separated by commas. The following options
are right now defined:</p>
<table id="table2" border="1" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p align="center"><b>z&lt;number&gt;</b></p>
</td>
<td>Enable zlib-compression for the message. The
&lt;number&gt; is the compression level. It can be 1 (lowest
gain, lowest CPU overhead) to 9 (maximum compression, highest CPU
overhead). The level can also be 0, which means "no compression". If
given, the "z" option is ignored. So this does not make an awful lot of
sense. There is hardly a difference between level 1 and 9 for typical
syslog messages. You can expect a compression gain between 0% and 30%
for typical messages. Very chatty messages may compress up to 50%, but
this is seldom seen with typically traffic. Please note that rsyslogd
checks the compression gain. Messages with 60 bytes or less will never
be compressed. This is because compression gain is pretty unlikely and
we prefer to save CPU cycles. Messages over that size are always
compressed. However, it is checked if there is a gain in compression
and only if there is, the compressed message is transmitted. Otherwise,
the uncompressed messages is transmitted. This saves the receiver CPU
cycles for decompression. It also prevents small message to actually
become larger in compressed form.
<p><b>Please note that when a TCP transport is used,
compression will also turn on syslog-transport-tls framing. See the "o"
option for important information on the implications.</b></p>
<p>Compressed messages are automatically detected and
decompressed by the receiver. There is nothing that needs to be
configured on the receiver side.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p align="center"><b>o</b></p>
</td>
<td><b>This option is experimental. Use at your own
risk and only if you know why you need it! If in doubt, do NOT turn it
on.</b>
<p>This option is only valid for plain TCP based
transports. It selects a different framing based on IETF internet draft
syslog-transport-tls-06. This framing offers some benefits over
traditional LF-based framing. However, the standardization effort is
not yet complete. There may be changes in upcoming versions of this
standard. Rsyslog will be kept in line with the standard. There is some
chance that upcoming changes will be incompatible to the current
specification. In this case, all systems using -transport-tls framing
must be upgraded. There will be no effort made to retain compatibility
between different versions of rsyslog. The primary reason for that is
that it seems technically impossible to provide compatibility between
some of those changes. So you should take this note very serious. It is
not something we do not *like* to do (and may change our mind if enough
people beg...), it is something we most probably *can not* do for
technical reasons (aka: you can beg as much as you like, it won't
change anything...).</p>
<p>The most important implication is that compressed syslog
messages via TCP must be considered with care. Unfortunately, it is
technically impossible to transfer compressed records over traditional
syslog plain tcp transports, so you are left with two evil choices...</p>

The hostname may be followed by a colon and the destination port.</p>
<p>The following is an example selector line with forwarding:</p>
<p>*.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @@(o,z9)192.168.0.1:1470</p>
<p>In this example, messages are forwarded via plain TCP with
experimental framing and maximum compression to the host 192.168.0.1 at
port 1470.</p>
<p>*.* @192.168.0.1</p>
<p>In the example above, messages are forwarded via UDP to the
machine 192.168.0.1, the destination port defaults to 514. Messages
will not be compressed.</p>
<p>Note that IPv6 addresses contain colons. So if an IPv6 address is specified
in the hostname part, rsyslogd could not detect where the IP address ends
and where the port starts. There is a syntax extension to support this:
put squary brackets around the address (e.g. "[2001::1]"). Square
brackets also work with real host names and IPv4 addresses, too.
<p>A valid sample to send messages to the IPv6 host 2001::1 at port 515
is as follows:
<p>*.* @[2001::1]:515
<p>This works with TCP, too.
<p><b>Note to sysklogd users:</b> sysklogd does <b>not</b>
support RFC 3164 format, which is the default forwarding template in
rsyslog. As such, you will experience duplicate hostnames if rsyslog is
the sender and sysklogd is the receiver. The fix is simple: you need to
use a different template. Use that one:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">$template
sysklogd,"&lt;%PRI%&gt;%TIMESTAMP% %syslogtag%%msg%\""<br>
*.* @192.168.0.1;sysklogd</p>
<h3>List of Users</h3>
<p>Usually critical messages are also directed to "root'' on
that machine. You can specify a list of users that shall get the
message by simply writing ":omusrmsg: followed by the login name. For example,
the send messages to root, use ":omusrmsg:root".
You may specify more than one user
by separating them with commas (",''). Do not repeat the ":omusrmsg:" prefix in
this case. For example, to send data to users root and rger, use
":omusrmsg:root,rger" (do not use ":omusrmsg:root,:omusrmsg:rger", this is invalid).
If they're logged in they get
the message.</p>
<h3>Everyone logged on</h3>
<p>Emergency messages often go to all users currently online to
notify them that something strange is happening with the system. To
specify this wall(1)-feature use an asterisk as the user message
destination(":omusrmsg:*'').</p>
<h3>Call Plugin</h3>
<p>This is a generic way to call an output plugin. The plugin
must support this functionality. Actual parameters depend on the
module, so see the module's doc on what to supply. The general syntax
is as follows:</p>
<p>:modname:params;template</p>
<p>Currently, the ommysql database output module supports this
syntax (in addtion to the "&gt;" syntax it traditionally
supported). For ommysql, the module name is "ommysql" and the params
are the traditional ones. The ;template part is not module specific, it
is generic rsyslog functionality available to all modules.</p>
<p>As an example, the ommysql module may be called as follows:</p>
<p>:ommysql:dbhost,dbname,dbuser,dbpassword;dbtemplate</p>
<p>For details, please see the "Database Table" section of this
documentation.</p>
<p>Note: as of this writing, the ":modname:" part is hardcoded
into the module. So the name to use is not necessarily the name the
module's plugin file is called.</p>
<h3>Database Table</h3>
<p>This allows logging of the message to a database table.
Currently, only MySQL databases are supported. However, other database
drivers will most probably be developed as plugins. By default, a <a href="http://www.monitorware.com/">MonitorWare</a>-compatible
schema is required for this to work. You can create that schema with
the createDB.SQL file that came with the rsyslog package. You can also<br>
use any other schema of your liking - you just need to define a proper
template and assign this template to the action.<br>
<br>
The database writer is called by specifying a greater-then sign
("&gt;") in front of the database connect information. Immediately
after that<br>
sign the database host name must be given, a comma, the database name,
another comma, the database user, a comma and then the user's password.
If a specific template is to be used, a semicolon followed by the
template name can follow the connect information. This is as follows:<br>
<br>
&gt;dbhost,dbname,dbuser,dbpassword;dbtemplate</p>
<p><b>Important: to use the database functionality, the
MySQL output module must be loaded in the config file</b> BEFORE
the first database table action is used. This is done by placing the</p>
<p><code><b>$ModLoad ommysql</b></code></p>
<p>directive some place above the first use of the database write
(we recommend doing at the the beginning of the config file).</p>
<h3>Discard</h3>
<p>If the discard action is carried out, the received message is
immediately discarded. No further processing of it occurs. Discard has
primarily been added to filter out messages before carrying on any
further processing. For obvious reasons, the results of "discard" are
depending on where in the configuration file it is being used. Please
note that once a message has been discarded there is no way to retrieve
it in later configuration file lines.</p>
<p>Discard can be highly effective if you want to filter out some
annoying messages that otherwise would fill your log files. To do that,
place the discard actions early in your log files. This often plays
well with property-based filters, giving you great freedom in
specifying what you do not want.</p>
<p>Discard is just the single tilde character with no further
parameters:</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>*.*&nbsp;&nbsp; ~</p>
<p>discards everything (ok, you can achive the same by not
running rsyslogd at all...).</p>
<h3>Output Channel</h3>
<p>Binds an output channel definition (see there for details) to
this action. Output channel actions must start with a $-sign, e.g. if
you would like to bind your output channel definition "mychannel" to
the action, use "$mychannel". Output channels support template
definitions like all all other actions.</p>
<h3>Shell Execute</h3>
<p>This executes a program in a subshell. The program is passed
the template-generated message as the only command line parameter.
Rsyslog waits until the program terminates and only then continues to
run.</p>
<p>^program-to-execute;template</p>
<p>The program-to-execute can be any valid executable. It
receives the template string as a single parameter (argv[1]).</p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> The Shell Execute action was added
to serve an urgent need. While it is considered reasonable save when
used with some thinking, its implications must be considered. The
current implementation uses a system() call to execute the command.
This is not the best way to do it (and will hopefully changed in
further releases). Also, proper escaping of special characters is done
to prevent command injection. However, attackers always find smart ways
to circumvent escaping, so we can not say if the escaping applied will
really safe you from all hassles. Lastly, rsyslog will wait until the
shell command terminates. Thus, a program error in it (e.g. an infinite
loop) can actually disable rsyslog. Even without that, during the
programs run-time no messages are processed by rsyslog. As the IP
stacks buffers are quickly overflowed, this bears an increased risk of
message loss. You must be aware of these implications. Even though they
are severe, there are several cases where the "shell execute" action is
very useful. This is the reason why we have included it in its current
form. To mitigate its risks, always a) test your program thoroughly, b)
make sure its runtime is as short as possible (if it requires a longer
run-time, you might want to spawn your own sub-shell asynchronously),
c) apply proper firewalling so that only known senders can send syslog
messages to rsyslog. Point c) is especially important: if rsyslog is
accepting message from any hosts, chances are much higher that an
attacker might try to exploit the "shell execute" action.</p>
<h3>Template Name</h3>
<p>Every ACTION can be followed by a template name. If so, that
template is used for message formatting. If no name is given, a
hard-coded default template is used for the action. There can only be
one template name for each given action. The default template is
specific to each action. For a description of what a template is and
what you can do with it, see "TEMPLATES" at the top of this document.</p>

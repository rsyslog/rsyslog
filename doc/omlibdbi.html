<h1>Generic Database Output Module (omlibdbi)</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; omlibdbi</b></p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards
&lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>This modules supports a large number of database systems via <a href="http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/">libdbi</a>.
Libdbi abstracts the database layer and provides drivers for many
systems. Drivers are available via the <a href="http://libdbi-drivers.sourceforge.net/">libdbi-drivers</a>
project. As of this writing, the following drivers are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.firebird.sourceforge.net/">Firebird/Interbase</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.freetds.org/">FreeTDS</a>
(provides access to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql">MS
SQL Server</a> and <a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/informationmanagement/adaptiveserverenterprise">Sybase</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
(also
supported via the native ommysql plugin in rsyslog)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>(also
supported via the native
ommysql plugin in rsyslog)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite/SQLite3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following drivers are in various stages of completion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ingres.com/">Ingres</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hughes.com.au/">mSQL</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These drivers seem to be quite usable, at
least from an rsyslog point of view.</p>
<p>Libdbi provides a slim layer between rsyslog and the actual
database engine. We have not yet done any performance testing (e.g.
omlibdbi vs. ommysql) but honestly believe that the performance impact
should be irrelevant, if at all measurable. Part of that assumption is
that rsyslog just does the "insert" and most of the time is spent
either in the database engine or rsyslog itself. It's hard to think of
any considerable time spent in the libdbi abstraction layer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup</span></p>
<p>In order for this plugin to work, you need to have libdbi, the
libdbi driver for your database backend and the client software for
your database backend installed. There are libdbi packages for many
distributions. Please note that rsyslogd requires a quite recent
version (0.8.3) of libdbi. It may work with older versions, but these
need some special ./configure options to support being called from a
dlopen()ed plugin (as omlibdbi is). So in short, you probably save you
a lot of headache if you make sure you have at least libdbi version
0.8.3 on your system.
</p>
<p><b>Module Parameters</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>template</b><br>
The default template to use. This template is used when no template is
explicitely specified in the action() statement.
<li><b>driverdirectory</b><br>
Path to the libdbi drivers. Usually,
you do not need to set it. If you installed libdbi-drivers at a
non-standard location, you may need to specify the directory here. If
you are unsure, do <b>not</b> use this configuration directive.
Usually, everything works just fine.
Note that this was an action() paramter in rsyslog versions below 7.3.0.
However, only the first action's driverdirectory parameter was actually used.
This has been cleaned up in 7.3.0, where this now is a module paramter.
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Action Parameters</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>server</b><br>Name or address of the MySQL server
<li><b>db</b><br>Database to use
<li><b>uid</b><br>logon userid used to connect to server. Must have proper permissions.
<li><b>pwd</b><br>the user's password
<li><b>template</b><br>Template to use when submitting messages.
<li><b>driver</b><br>
Name of the dbidriver to use, see libdbi-drivers documentation. As a
quick excerpt, at least those were available at the time of this
writiting "mysql" (suggest to use ommysql instead), "firebird" (Firbird
and InterBase), "ingres", "msql", "Oracle", "sqlite", "sqlite3",
"freetds" (for Microsoft SQL and Sybase) and "pgsql" (suggest to use
ompgsql instead).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Legacy (pre-v6) Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended NOT to use legacy format.
<ul>
<li><i>$ActionLibdbiDriverDirectory /path/to/dbd/drivers</i>
- like the driverdirectory action parameter.
<li><i>$ActionLibdbiDriver drivername</i> - like the drivername action parameter
<li><i>$ActionLibdbiHost hostname</i> - like the server action parameter
<li><i>$ActionLibdbiUserName user</i> - like the uid action parameter
<li><i>$ActionlibdbiPassword</i> - like the pwd action parameter
<li><i>$ActionlibdbiDBName db</i> - like the db action parameter
<li><i>selector line: :omlibdbi:<code>;template</code></i><br>
executes the recently configured omlibdbi action. The ;template part is
optional. If no template is provided, a default template is used (which
is currently optimized for MySQL - sorry, folks...)</li>
</ul>
<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<p>You must make sure that any templates used for omlibdbi
properly escape strings. This is usually done by supplying the SQL (or
STDSQL) option to the template. Omlibdbi rejects templates without this
option for security reasons. However, omlibdbi does not detect if you
used the right option for your backend. Future versions of rsyslog
(with full&nbsp;expression&nbsp; support) will provide advanced
ways of handling this situation. So far, you must be careful. The
default template provided by rsyslog is suitable for MySQL, but not
necessarily for your database backend. Be careful!</p>
<p>If you receive the rsyslog error message "libdbi or libdbi
drivers not present on this system" you may either not have libdbi and
its drivers installed or (very probably) the version is earlier than
0.8.3. In this case, you need to make sure you have at least 0.8.3 and
the libdbi driver for your database backend present on your system.</p><p>I
do not have most of the database supported by omlibdbi in my lab. So it
received limited cross-platform tests. If you run into troubles, be
sure the let us know at <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com">http://www.rsyslog.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>The following sample writes all syslog messages to the
database "syslog_db" on mysqlsever.example.com. The server is MySQL and
being accessed under the account of "user" with password "pwd" (if you
have empty passwords, just remove the $ActionLibdbiPassword line).<br>

<p><b>Legacy Sample:</b></p>

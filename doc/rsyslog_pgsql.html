an alternative enhanced syslog daemon natively supporting MySQL and
PostgreSQL. I describe the components needed to be installed and how

supports a variety of databases. While this guide is still MySQL- and
PostgreSQL-focused, you can probably use it together with other ones
too. You just need to modify a few settings.</I></SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Background</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In many cases, syslog data is simply
written to text files. This approach has some advantages, most
notably it is very fast and efficient. However, data stored in text
files is not readily accessible for real-time viewing and analysis.
To do that, the messages need to be in a database. There are various
ways to store syslog messages in a database. For example, some have
the syslogd write text files which are later feed via a separate
script into the database. Others have written scripts taking the data
(via a pipe) from a non-database-aware syslogd and store them as they
appear. Some others use database-aware syslogds and make them write
the data directly to the database. In this paper, I use that &quot;direct
write&quot; approach. I think it is superior, because the syslogd
itself knows the status of the database connection and thus can
handle it intelligently (well ... hopefully ;)). I use rsyslogd to
acomplish this, simply because I have initiated the rsyslog project
with database-awareness as one goal.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>One word of caution:</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">
while message storage in the database provides an excellent
foundation for interactive analysis, it comes at a cost. Database i/o
is considerably slower than text file i/o. As such, directly writing
to the database makes sense only if your message volume is low enough
to allow a) the syslogd, b) the network, and c) the database server
to catch up with it. Some time ago, I have written a paper on
</SPAN><A HREF="http://www.monitorware.com/Common/en/Articles/performance-optimizing-syslog-server.php">optimizing
syslog server performance</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">. While this paper
talks about Window-based solutions, the ideas in it are generic
enough to apply here, too. So it might be worth reading if you
anticipate medium high to high traffic. If you anticipate really high
traffic (or very large traffic spikes), you should seriously consider
forgetting about direct database writes - in my opinion, such a
situation needs either a very specialized system or a different
approach (the text-file-to-database approach might work better for
you in this case). </SPAN>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Overall System Setup</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">In this paper, I concentrate on
the server side. If you are thinking about interactive syslog message
review, you probably want to centralize syslog. In such a scenario,
you have multiple machines (the so-called clients) send their data to
a central machine (called server in this context). While I expect
such a setup to be typical when you are interested in storing
messages in the database, I do not describe how to set it up. This is
beyond the scope of this paper. If you search a little, you will
probably find many good descriptions on </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">how
to centralize syslog. If you do that, it might be a good idea to do
it securely, so you might also be interested in my paper on
</SPAN><A HREF="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-rsyslog_stunnel.html">ssl-encrypting
syslog message transfer</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">No matter how the messages arrive at
the server, their processing is always the same. So you can use this
paper in combination with any description for centralized syslog
reporting.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">As I already said, I use
rsyslogd on the server. It has intrinsic support for talking to the
supported databases. For obvious reasons, we also need an instance of
MySQL or PostgreSQL running. To keep us focused, the setup of the
database itself is also beyond the scope of this paper. I assume that
you have successfully installed the database and also have a
front-end at hand to work with it (for example, </SPAN><A HREF="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">
or </SPAN><A HREF="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/">phpPgAdmin</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">.
Please make sure that this is installed, actually working and you
have a basic understanding of how to handle it.</SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Setting up the system</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">You need to download and
install rsyslogd first. Obtain it from the </SPAN><A HREF="http://www.rsyslog.com/">rsyslog
site</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">. Make sure that you disable stock
syslogd, otherwise you will experience some difficulties. On some
distributions &nbsp;(Fedora 8 and above, for example), rsyslog may
already by the default syslogd, in which case you obviously do not
need to do anything specific. For many others, there are prebuild
packages available. If you use either, please make sure that you have
the required database plugins for your database available. It usually
is a separate package and typically </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>not</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">
installed by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">It is important to understand
how rsyslogd talks to the database. In rsyslogd, there is the concept
of &quot;templates&quot;. Basically, a template is a string that
includes some replacement characters, which are called &quot;properties&quot;
in rsyslog. Properties are accessed via the &quot;</SPAN><A HREF="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-property_replacer.html">Property
Replacer</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">&quot;. Simply said, you access
properties by including their name between percent signs inside the
template. For example, if the syslog message is &quot;Test&quot;, the
template &quot;%msg%&quot; would be expanded to &quot;Test&quot;.
Rsyslogd supports sending template text as a SQL statement to the
database. As such, the template must be a valid SQL statement. There
is no limit in what the statement might be, but there are some
obvious and not so obvious choices. For example, a template &quot;drop
table xxx&quot; is possible, but does not make an awful lot of sense.
In practice, you will always use an &quot;insert&quot; statement
inside the template.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">An example: if you would just like to
store the msg part of the full syslog message, you have probably
created a table &quot;syslog&quot; with a single column &quot;message&quot;.
In such a case, a good template would be &quot;insert into
syslog(message) values ('%msg%')&quot;. With the example above, that
would be expanded to &quot;insert into syslog(message)
values('Test')&quot;. This expanded string is then sent to the
database. It's that easy, no special magic. The only thing you must
ensure is that your template expands to a proper SQL statement and
that this statement matches your database design.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Does that mean you need to
create database schema yourself and also must fully understand
rsyslogd's properties? No, that's not needed. Because we anticipated
that folks are probably more interested in getting things going
instead of designing them from scratch. So we have provided a default
schema as well as build-in support for it. This schema also offers an
additional benefit: rsyslog is part of </SPAN><A HREF="http://www.adiscon.com/en/">Adiscon</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">'s
</SPAN><A HREF="http://www.monitorware.com/en/">MonitorWare product
line</A><SPAN LANG="en-US"> (which includes open source and closed
source members). All of these tools share the same default schema and
know how to operate on it. For this reason, the default schema is
also called the &quot;MonitorWare Schema&quot;. If you use it, you
can simply add </SPAN><A HREF="http://www.phplogcon.org/">phpLogCon,
a GPLed syslog web interface</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">, to your system
and have instant interactive access to your database. So there are
some benefits in using the provided schema.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The schema definition is contained in
the file &quot;createDB.sql&quot;. It comes with the rsyslog package
and one can be found for each supported database type (in the plugins
directory). Review it to check that the database name is acceptable
for you. Be sure to leave the table and field names unmodified,
because otherwise you need to customize rsyslogd's default sql
template, which we do not do in this paper. Then, run the script with
your favorite SQL client. Double-check that the table was
successfully created.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">It is important to note that the
correct database encoding must be used so that the database will
accept strings independend of the string encoding. This is an
important part because it can not be guarantied that all syslog
messages will have a defined character encoding. This is especially
true if the rsyslog-Server will collect messages from different
clients and different products. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For example PostgreSQL may refuse to
accept messages if you would set the database encoding to “UTF8”
while a client is sending invalid byte sequences for that encoding. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Database support in rsyslog is
integrated via loadable plugin modules. To use the database
functionality, the database plugin must be enabled in the config file
BEFORE the first database table action is used. This is done by
placing the</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="western"><CODE>$ModLoad ommysql</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS="western">directive at the begining of /etc/rsyslog.conf for
MySQL and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="western"><CODE>$ModLoad ompgsql</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS="western"><CODE><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">for
PostgreSQL.</FONT></CODE></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">For
other databases, use their plugin name (e.g. omoracle).</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, we need to tell rsyslogd to write data to
the database. As we use the default schema, we do NOT need to define
a template for this. We can use the hardcoded one (rsyslogd handles
the proper template linking). So all we need to do e.g. for MySQL is
add a simple selector line to /etc/rsyslog.conf:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="western"><CODE>*.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:ommysql:database-server,database-name,database-userid,database-password</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS="western">Again, other databases have other selector names,
e.g. &quot;:ompgsql:&quot; instead of &quot;:ommysql:&quot;. See the
output plugin's documentation for details.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In many cases, the database will run
on the local machine. In this case, you can simply use &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
for <I>database-server</I>. This can be especially advisable, if you
do not need to expose the database to any process outside of the
local machine. In this case, you can simply bind it to 127.0.0.1,
which provides a quite secure setup. Of course, rsyslog also supports
remote database instances. In that case, use the remote server name
(e.g. mydb.example.com) or IP-address. The <I>database-name</I> by
default is &quot;Syslog&quot;. If you have modified the default, use
your name here. <I>Database-userid</I> and <I>-password</I> are the
credentials used to connect to the database. As they are stored in
clear text in rsyslog.conf, that user should have only the least
possible privileges. It is sufficient to grant it INSERT privileges
to the systemevents table, only. As a side note, it is strongly
advisable to make the rsyslog.conf file readable by root only - if
you make it world-readable, everybody could obtain the password (and
eventually other vital information from it). In our example, let's
assume you have created a database user named &quot;syslogwriter&quot;
with a password of &quot;topsecret&quot; (just to say it bluntly:
such a password is NOT a good idea...). If your database is on the
local machine, your rsyslog.conf line might look like in this sample:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="western"><CODE>*.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
:ommysql:127.0.0.1,Syslog,syslogwriter,topsecret</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS="western">Save rsyslog.conf, restart rsyslogd - and you
should see syslog messages being stored in the &quot;systemevents&quot;
table!</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The example line stores every message
to the database. Especially if you have a high traffic volume, you
will probably limit the amount of messages being logged. This is easy
to accomplish: the &quot;write database&quot; action is just a
regular selector line. As such, you can apply normal selector-line
filtering. If, for example, you are only interested in messages from
the mail subsystem, you can use the following selector line:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="western"><CODE>mail.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:ommysql:127.0.0.1,syslog,syslogwriter,topsecret</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P CLASS="western">Review the <A HREF="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-rsyslog_conf.html">rsyslog.conf</A>
documentation for details on selector lines and their filtering.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>You have now completed
everything necessary to store syslog messages to the a database.</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">
If you would like to try out a front-end, you might want to look at
</SPAN><A HREF="http://www.phplogcon.org/">phpLogCon</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">,
which displays syslog data in a browser. As of this writing,
phpLogCon is not yet a powerful tool, but it's open source, so it
might be a starting point for your own solution.</SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">On Reliability...</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Rsyslogd writes syslog messages
directly to the database. This implies that the database must be
available at the time of message arrival. If the database is offline,
no space is left or something else goes wrong - rsyslogd can not
write the database record. If rsyslogd is unable to store a message,
it performs one retry. This is helpful if the database server was
restarted. In this case, the previous connection was broken but a
reconnect immediately succeeds. However, if the database is down for
an extended period of time, an immediate retry does not help.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Message loss in this scenario
can easily be prevented with rsyslog. All you need to do is run the
database writer in queued mode. This is now described in a generic
way and I do not intend to duplicate it here. So please be sure to
read &quot;</SPAN><A HREF="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-rsyslog_high_database_rate.html">Handling
a massive syslog database insert rate with Rsyslog</A><SPAN LANG="en-US">&quot;,
which describes the scenario and also includes configuration
examples.</SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Conclusion</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">With minimal effort, you can use
rsyslogd to write syslog messages to a database. You can even make it
absolutely fail-safe and protect it against database server downtime.
Once the messages are arrived there, you can interactively review and
analyze them. In practice, the messages are also stored in text files
for longer-term archival and the databases are cleared out after some
time (to avoid becoming too slow). If you expect an extremely high
syslog message volume, storing it in real-time to the database may
outperform your database server. In such cases, either filter out
some messages or used queued mode (which in general is recommended
with databases).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The method outlined in this paper
provides an easy to setup and maintain solution for most use cases.</P>

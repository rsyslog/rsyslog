<h1>Log Message Normalization Module</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mmnormalize</b></p>
<p><b>Available since: </b>6.1.2+
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards &lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>This module provides the capability to normalize log messages via
<a href="http://www.liblognorm.com">liblognorm</a>. Thanks to liblognorm, unstructured text,
like usually found in log messages, can very quickly be parsed and put into
a normal form. This is done so quickly, that it should be possible
to normalize events in realtime.
<p>This module is implemented via the output module interface. This means that
mmnormalize should be called just like an action. After it has been called,
the normalized message properties are avaialable and can be accessed. These properties
are called the "CEE/lumberjack" properties, because liblognorm creates a format that is 
inspired by the CEE/lumberjack approach.
<p><b>Please note:</b> CEE/lumberjack properties are different from regular properties.
They have always "$!" prepended to the property name given in the rulebase. Such a 
property needs to be called with <b>%$!propertyname%</b>.
<p>Note that mmnormalize should only be called once on each message. Behaviour is
undefined if multiple calls to mmnormalize happen for the same message.
</p>
<p><b>Action Parameters</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ruleBase</b> [word]<br>
Specifies which rulebase file is to use. If there are
multiple mmnormalize instances, each one can use a different file. However,
a single instance can use only a single file. This parameter MUST be given,
because normalization can only happen based on a rulebase. It is recommended
that an absolute path name is given. Information on how to create the rulebase 
can be found in the <a href="http://www.liblognorm.com/files/manual/index.html">liblognorm manual</a>.
<li><b>useRawMsg</b> [boolean]<br>
Specifies if the raw message should be used for normalization (on) or just the
MSG part of the message (off). Default is "off".
</ul>
<p><b>Legacy Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>$mmnormalizeRuleBase &lt;rulebase-file&gt; - equivalent to the "ruleBase"
parameter.
<li>$mmnormalizeUseRawMsg &lt;on/off&gt; - equivalent to the "useRawMsg" 
parameter.
</ul>
<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<p>None known at this time.
</ul>
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>This activates the module and applies normalization to all messages:<br>

<textarea rows="2" cols="60">module(load="mmnormalize")
action(type="mmnormalize" ruleBase="/path/to/rulebase.rb")
</textarea>
<p>The same in legacy format:</p>
<textarea rows="3" cols="60">$ModLoad mmnormalize
$mmnormalizeRuleBase /path/to/rulebase.rb

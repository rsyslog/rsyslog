<h1>Input Module to Generate Periodic Statistics of Internal Counters</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impstats</b></p>
<p><b>Available since: </b>5.7.0+, 6.1.1+
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards &lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>This module provides periodic output of rsyslog internal counters.
Note that the whole statistics system is currently under development. So
availability and format of counters may change and is not yet stable (so be
prepared to change your trending scripts when you upgrade to a newer rsyslog version).
<p>The set of available counters will be output as a set of syslog messages. This
output is periodic, with the interval being configurable (default is 5 minutes).
Be sure that your configuration records the counter messages (default is syslog.=info).
Besides logging to the regular syslog stream, the module can also be configured to
write statistics data into a (local) file.
<p>Note that loading this module has impact on rsyslog performance. Depending on
settings, this impact may be noticeable (for high-load environments).
<p>The rsyslog website has an updated overview of available
<a href="http://rsyslog.com/rsyslog-statistic-counter/">rsyslog statistic counters</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Note that there is a
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/impstats-analyzer/">rsyslog statistics
online analyzer</a> available.</b> It can be given a impstats-generated file and
will return problems it detects. Note that the analyzer cannot replace a
human in getting things right, but it is expected to be a good aid in starting
to understand and gain information from the pstats logs.

<p><b>Module Confguration Parameters</b>:</p>
<p>This module supports module parameters, only.
<ul>
	<li><b>interval </b>[seconds] (default 300 [5minutes])<br>
	Sets the interval, in <b>seconds</b> at which messages are generated. Please note that the
	actual interval may be a bit longer. We do not try to be precise and so the interval is
	actually a sleep period which is entered after generating all messages. So the actual 
	interval is what is configured here plus the actual time required to generate messages.
	In general, the difference should not really matter.
	<br></li>
	<li><b>facility </b>[facility number]<br>
	The numerical syslog facility code to be used for generated messages. Default
	is 5 (syslog). This is useful for filtering messages.
	<br></li>
	<li><b>severity </b>[severity number]<br>
	The numerical syslog severity code to be used for generated messages. Default
	is 6 (info).This is useful for filtering messages.
	<br></li>
	<li><b>resetCounters </b>[<b>off</b>/on] - available since 7.5.3<br>
	When set to "on", counters are automatically reset after they are emitted. In that
	case, the contain only deltas to the last value emitted. When set
	to "off", counters always accumulate their values.
	Note that in auto-reset mode not all counters can be reset. Some counters (like queue size)
	are directly obtained from internal object and cannot be modified. Also, auto-resetting
	introduces some additional slight inaccuracies due to the multi-threaded nature of 
	rsyslog and the fact that for performance reasons it cannot serialize access
	to counter variables.</br>
	As an alternative to auto-reset mode, you can use rsyslog's statistics
	manipulation scripts to create delta values from the regular statistic
	logs. This is the suggested method if deltas are not necessarily needed in
	real-time.
	<br></li>
	<li><b>format </b>[json/cee/<b>legacy</b>] - available since 6.3.8<br>
	Specifies the format of emitted stats messages. The default of "legacy" is
	compatible with pre v6-rsyslog. The other options provide support for
	structured formats (note the "cee" is actually "project lumberack" logging).
	<br></li>
	<li><b>log.syslog </b>[<b>on</b>/off] - available since 7.3.6<br>
	This is a boolean setting specifying if data should be sent
	to the usual syslog stream. This is useful if custom formatting
	or more elaborate processing is desired. However, output is placed
	under the same restrictions as regular syslog data, especially in
	regard to the queue position (stats data may sit for an extended
	period of time in queues if they are full).<br></li>
	<li><b>log.file </b>[file name] - available since 7.3.6<br>
	If specified, statistics data is written the specified file. For
	robustness, this should be a local file. The file format cannot be
	customized, it consists of a date header, followed by a colon, 
	followed by the actual statistics record, all on one line. Only
	very limited error handling is done, so if things go wrong stats
	records will probably be lost. Logging to file an be a useful
	alternative if for some reasons (e.g. full queues) the regular
	syslog stream method shall not be used solely. Note that turning
	on file logging does NOT turn of syslog logging. If that is desired
	log.syslog="off" must be explicitely set.
	<br></li>
	<li><b>Ruleset</b> [ruleset] - available since 7.5.6<br>
	Binds the listener to a specific <a href="multi_ruleset.html">ruleset</a>.</li>
	
</ul>
<p><b>Legacx Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
A limited set of parameters can also be set via the legacy configuration
syntax. Note that this is intended as an upward compatibilit layer, so
newer features are intentionally <b>not</b> available via legacy directives.
<ul>
<li>$PStatInterval &lt;Seconds&gt; - same as the "interval" parameter.
<li>$PStatFacility &lt;numerical facility&gt; - same as the "facility" parameter.
<li>$PStatSeverity &lt;numerical severity&gt; - same as the "severity" parameter.
<li>$PStatJSON &lt;on/<b>off</b>&gt; (rsyslog v6.3.8+ only)<br>
If set to on, stats messages are emitted as structured cee-enhanced syslog. If
set to off, legacy format is used (which is compatible with pre v6-rsyslog).

<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li>This module MUST be loaded right at the top of rsyslog.conf, otherwise 
stats may not get turned on in all places.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Samples:</b></p>
<p>This activates the module and records messages to /var/log/rsyslog-stats in 10 minute intervals:<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="5" cols="60">module(load="impstats" interval="600" severity="7")

# to actually gather the data:
syslog.=debug  /var/log/rsyslog-stats
</textarea>
<p><b>Legacy Sample:</b></p>
<p>This activates the module and records messages to /var/log/rsyslog-stats in 10 minute intervals:</p>
<textarea rows="6" cols="60">$ModLoad impstats
$PStatInterval 600
$PStatSeverity 7

syslog.=debug  /var/log/rsyslog-stats
</textarea>
<p>In the next sample, the default interval of 5 minutes is used. However, this time
stats data is NOT emitted to the syslog stream but to a local file instead.
<p>
<textarea rows="3" cols="70">module(load="impstats" interval="600" severity="7"
       log.syslog="off" /* need to turn log stream logging off! */
       log.file="/path/to/local/stats.log")
</textarea>
<p>And finally, we log to both the regular syslog log stream as well as a file.
Within the log stream, we forward the data records to another server:
<p>
<textarea rows="4" cols="70">module(load="impstats" interval="600" severity="7"
       log.file="/path/to/local/stats.log")

syslog.=debug  @central.example.net
</textarea>

<h1>The Property Replacer</h1>
<p><b>The property replacer is a core component in
rsyslogd's output system.</b> A syslog message has a number of
well-defined properties (see below). Each of this properties can be
accessed <b>and</b> manipulated by the property replacer.
With it, it is easy to use only part of a property value or manipulate
the value, e.g. by converting all characters to lower case.</p>
<h1>Accessing Properties</h1>
<p>Syslog message properties are used inside templates. They are
accessed by putting them between percent signs. Properties can be
modified by the property replacer. The full syntax is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><b><code>%propname:fromChar:toChar:options:fieldname%</code></b></blockquote>
<h2>Available Properties</h2>
<p><b><code>propname</code></b> is the
name of the property to access. It is case-insensitive (prior to 3.17.0, they were case-senstive).
Currently supported are:</p>
<table>

<td><b>parsesuccess</b></td>
<td>This returns the status of the <b>last</b> called higher level parser,
like mmjsonparse. A higher level parser parses the actual message for additional
structured data and maintains an extra property table while doing so (this is
often referred to as "cee data" because the idea was originally rooted in the
cee effort, only (but has been extended since then). Note that higher level
parsers must explicitely support (and set) this property. So, depending on the
parser, it may not be set correctly.
<br>If the parser properly supports it, the value "OK" means that parsing was
successfull, while "FAIL" means the parser could not successfully obtain any data.
Failure state is not necessarily an error. For example, it may simple indicate
that the cee-enhanced syslog parser (mmjsonparse) did not detect cee-enhanced format,
what can be totally valid. Using this property, further processing of the message
can be directed based on this parsing outcome. If no parser has been called at the
time this property is accessed, it will contain "FAIL".
<br><b>This property is available since version 6.3.8.</b>
</td>
</tr>
<td><b>inputname</b></td>
<td>The name of the input module that generated the
message (e.g. "imuxsock", "imudp"). Note that not all modules
necessarily provide this property. If not provided, it is an
empty string. Also note that the input module may provide
any value of its liking. Most importantly, it is <b>not</b>
necessarily the module input name. Internal sources can also
provide inputnames. Currently, "rsyslogd" is defined as inputname
for messages internally generated by rsyslogd, for example startup
and shutdown and error messages.
This property is considered useful when trying to filter messages
based on where they originated - e.g. locally generated messages
("rsyslogd", "imuxsock", "imklog") should go to a different place
than messages generated somewhere.

<p>Properties starting with a $-sign are so-called system
properties. These do NOT stem from the message but are rather
internally-generated.</p>
<h2>Legacy Character Positions</h2>
<p><b><code>FromChar</code></b> and <b><code>toChar</code></b>
are used to build substrings. They specify the offset within the string
that should be copied. Offset counting starts at 1, so if you need to
obtain the first 2 characters of the message text, you can use this
syntax: "%msg:1:2%". If you do not whish to specify from and to, but
you want to specify options, you still need to include the colons. For
example, if you would like to convert the full message text to lower
case, use "%msg:::lowercase%". If you would like to extract from a
position until the end of the string, you can place a dollar-sign ("$")
in toChar (e.g. %msg:10:$%, which will extract from position 10 to the
end of the string).</p>
<p>There is also support for <b>regular expressions</b>.
To use them, you need to place a "R" into FromChar. This tells rsyslog
that a regular expression instead of position-based extraction is
desired. The actual regular expression must then be provided in toChar.
The regular expression <b>must</b> be followed by the
string "--end". It denotes the end of the regular expression and will
not become part of it. If you are using regular expressions, the
property replacer will return the part of the property text that
matches the regular expression. An example for a property replacer
sequence with a regular expression is: "%msg:R:.*Sev:. \(.*\)
\[.*--end%"</p>
<p>It is possible to specify some parametes after the "R". These are
comma-separated. They are:
<p>R,&lt;regexp-type&gt;,&lt;submatch&gt;,&lt;<a href="rsyslog_conf_nomatch.html">nomatch</a>&gt;,&lt;match-number&gt;
<p>regexp-type is either "BRE" for Posix basic regular expressions or
"ERE" for extended ones. The string must be given in upper case. The
default is "BRE" to be consistent with earlier versions of rsyslog that
did not support ERE. The submatch identifies the submatch to be used
with the result. A single digit is supported. Match 0 is the full match,
while 1 to 9 are the acutal submatches. The match-number identifies which match to
use, if the expression occurs more than once inside the string. Please note
that the first match is number 0, the second 1 and so on. Up to 10 matches
(up to number 9) are supported. Please note that it would be more
natural to have the match-number in front of submatch, but this would break 
backward-compatibility. So the match-number must be specified after "nomatch".
<p><a href="rsyslog_conf_nomatch.html">nomatch</a> specifies what should
be used in case no match is found.
<p>The following is a sample of an ERE expression that takes the first
submatch from the message string and replaces the expression with
the full field if no match is found:
<p>%msg:R,ERE,1,FIELD:for (vlan[0-9]*):--end%
<p>and this takes the first submatch of the second match of said expression:
<p>%msg:R,ERE,1,FIELD,1:for (vlan[0-9]*):--end%
<p><b>Please note: there is also a
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/tool-regex">rsyslog regular expression checker/generator</a>
online tool available.</b> With that tool, you can check your regular expressions and
also generate a valid property replacer sequence. Usage of this tool is recommended.
Depending on the version offered, the tool may not cover all subleties that can
be done with the property replacer. It concentrates on the most often used cases. So it
is still useful to hand-craft expressions for demanding environments.
<p><b>Also, extraction can be done based on so-called
"fields"</b>. To do so, place a "F" into FromChar. A field in its
current definition is anything that is delimited by a delimiter
character. The delimiter by default is TAB (US-ASCII value 9). However,
if can be changed to any other US-ASCII character by specifying a comma
and the <b>decimal</b> US-ASCII value of the delimiter
immediately after the "F". For example, to use comma (",") as a
delimiter, use this field specifier: "F,44".&nbsp; If your syslog
data is delimited, this is a quicker way to extract than via regular
expressions (actually, a *much* quicker way). Field counting starts at
1. Field zero is accepted, but will always lead to a "field not found"
error. The same happens if a field number higher than the number of
fields in the property is requested. The field number must be placed in
the "ToChar" parameter. An example where the 3rd field (delimited by
TAB) from the msg property is extracted is as follows: "%msg:F:3%". The
same example with semicolon as delimiter is "%msg:F,59:3%".</p>
<p>Please note that the special characters "F" and "R" are
case-sensitive. Only upper case works, lower case will return an error.
There are no white spaces permitted inside the sequence (that will lead
to error messages and will NOT provide the intended result).</p>
<p>Each occurence of the field delimiter starts a new field. However, 
if you add a plus sign ("+") after the field delimiter, multiple
delimiters, one  immediately after the others, are treated as separate
fields. This can be useful in cases where the syslog message contains
such sequences. A frequent case may be with code that is written as
follows:</p>
<code><pre>
int n, m;
...
syslog(LOG_ERR, "%d test %6d", n, m);
</pre></code>
<p>This will result into things like this in syslog messages:
"1 test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2", 
"1 test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23", 
"1 test&nbsp;&nbsp;234567" 
<p>As you can see, the fields are delimited by space characters, but
their exact number is unknown. They can properly be extracted as follows:
<p>
"%msg:F,32:2%" to "%msg:F,32+:2%".
<p>This feature was suggested by Zhuang Yuyao and implemented by him.
It is modeled after perl compatible regular expressions.

<h2>Property Options</h2>
<b><code>property options</code></b> are
case-insensitive. They are available as of version 6.5.0.
Currently, the following options are defined:

It is most useful to set, for example, the name for JSON-based fields (like used in ommngodb). For
text-based modules, it is simply ignored.
If not specified, the original property name is used, with the exception of properties starting with
"$!", where that prefix is removed. Note that unnamaned constants are NOT forwarded to output modules
that expect structure (like ommnogodb). To pass constants, an outname must be set.

followed by another non-space character, which can lead some log parsers to misinterpret
what is the tag and what the message. The problem finally surfaced when the klog module
was restructured and the tag correctly written. It exists with other message sources,
too. The solution was the introduction of this special property replacer option. Now,
the default template can contain a conditional space, which exists only if the

<p>To use multiple options, simply place them one after each other with a comma delmimiting
them. For example "escape-cc,sp-if-no-1st-sp". If you use conflicting options together,
the last one will override the previous one. For example, using "escape-cc,drop-cc" will
use drop-cc and "drop-cc,escape-cc" will use escape-cc mode.
<h2>Fieldname</h2>
<p><i>(available in 6.3.9+)</i>
<p>This field permits to specify a field name for structured-data emitting property replacer
options. It was initially introduced to support the "jsonf" option, for which it provides
the capability to set an alternative field name. If it is not specified, it defaults to 
the property name.

<h1>rsyslog.conf configuration file</h1>
<p><b>This document is currently being enhanced. Please pardon its current 
appearance.</b></p>
<p><b>Rsyslogd is configured via the rsyslog.conf file</b>, typically found in 
/etc. By default, rsyslogd reads the file /etc/rsyslog.conf.</p>
<p>While rsyslogd contains enhancements over standard syslogd, efforts have been 
made to keep the configuration file as compatible as possible. While, for 
obvious reasons, <a href="features.html">enhanced features</a> require a 
different config file syntax, rsyslogd should be able to work with a standard 
syslog.conf file. This is especially useful while you are migrating from syslogd 
to rsyslogd.</p>
<h2>Basic Structure</h2>
<p>Rsyslog supports standard sysklogd's configuration file format and extends 
it. So in general, you can take a &quot;normal&quot; syslog.conf and use it together with 
rsyslogd. It will understand everything. However, to use most of rsyslogd's 
unique features, you need to add extended configuration directives.<p>Rsyslogd 
supports the classical, selector-based rule lines. They are still at the heart 
of it and all actions are initiated via rule lines. A rule lines is any line not 
starting with a $ or the comment sign (#). Lines starting with $ carry 
rsyslog-specific directives.<p>Every rule line consists of two fields, a selector field and an action field. 
These two fields are separated by one or more spaces or tabs. The selector field 
specifies a pattern of facilities and priorities belonging to the specified 
action.<br>
<br>
Lines starting with a hash mark (&quot;#'') and empty lines are ignored.
<h2>Allowed Sender Lists</h2>
<p>Allowed sender lists can be used to specify which remote systems are allowed 
to send syslog messages to rsyslogd. With them, further hurdles can be placed 
between an attacker and rsyslogd. If a message from a system not in the allowed 
sender list is received, that message is discarded. A diagnostic message is 
logged, so that the fact is recorded (this message can be turned off with the 
&quot;-w&quot; rsyslogd command line option).</p>
<p>Allowed sender lists can be defined for UDP and TCP senders seperately. There 
can be as many allowed senders as needed. The syntax to specify them is:</p>
<p><code><b>$AllowedSender &lt;protocol&gt;, ip[/bits], ip[/bits]</b></code></p>
<p>&quot;$AllowedSender&quot; is the directive - it must be written exactly as shown and 
the $ must start at the first column of the line. &quot;&lt;protocol&gt;&quot; is either &quot;UDP&quot; 
or &quot;TCP&quot;. It must immediately be followed by the comma, else you will receive an 
error message. &quot;ip[/bits]&quot; is a machine or network ip address as in 
&quot;192.0.2.0/24&quot; or &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;. If the &quot;/bits&quot; part is omitted, a single host is 
assumed (32 bits or mask 255.255.255.255). &quot;/0&quot; is not allowed, because that 
would match any sending system. If you intend to do that, just remove all $AllowedSender 
directives. If more than 32 bits are requested, they are adjusted to 32. 
Multiple allowed senders can be specified in a comma-delimited list. Also, 
multiple $AllowedSender lines can be given. They are all combined into one UDP 
and one TCP list. Performance-wise, it is good to specify those allowed senders 
with high traffic volume before those with lower volume. As soon as a match is 
found, no further evaluation is necessary and so you can save CPU cycles.</p>
<p>Rsyslogd handles allowed sender detection very early in the code, nearly as 
the first action after receiving a message. This keeps the access to potential 
vulnerable code in rsyslog at a minimum. However, it is still a good idea to 
impose allowed sender limitations via firewalling.</p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> by UDP design, rsyslogd can not identify a spoofed sender 
address in UDP syslog packets. As such, a malicous person could spoof the adress 
of an allowed sender, send such packets to rsyslogd and rsyslogd would accept 
them as being from the faked sender. To prevent this, use syslog via TCP 
exclusively. If you need to use UDP-based syslog, make sure that you do proper 
egress and ingress filtering at the firewall and router level.</p>
<p>An example for an allowed sender list is as follows:</p>
<p><code><b>$AllowedSender UDP, 127.0.0.1, 192.0.2.0/24</b></code></p>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>Templates are a key feature of rsyslog. They allow to specify any format a user 
might want. Every output in rsyslog uses templates - this holds true for files, 
user messages and so on. The database writer expects its template to be a proper 
SQL statement - so this is highly customizable too. You might ask how does all 
of this work when no templates at all are specified. Good question ;) The answer 
is simple, though. Templates compatible with the stock syslogd formats are 
hardcoded into rsyslogd. So if no template is specified, we use one of these 
hardcoded templates. Search for &quot;template_&quot; in syslogd.c and you will find the 
hardcoded ones.</p>
<p>A template consists of a template directive, a name, the actual template text 
and optional options. A sample is:</p>
<blockquote><code>$template MyTemplateName,&quot;\7Text %property% some more text\n&quot;,&lt;options&gt;</code></blockquote>
<p>The &quot;$template&quot; is the template directive. It tells rsyslog that this line 
contains a template. &quot;MyTemplateName&quot; is the template name. All
other config lines refer to this name. The text within quotes is the actual 
template text. The backslash is an escape character, much as it is in C. It does 
all these &quot;cool&quot; things. For example, \7 rings the bell (this is an ASCII 
value), \n is a new line. C programmers and perl coders have the advantage of 
knowing this, but the set in rsyslog is a bit restricted currently.
<p>
All text in the template is used literally, except for things within percent 
signs. These are properties and allow you access to the contents of the syslog 
message. Properties are accessed via the property replacer (nice name, huh) and 
it can do cool things, too. For example, it can pick a substring or do 
date-specific formatting. More on this is below, on some lines of the property 
replacer.<br>
<br>
The &lt;options&gt; part is optional. It carries options influencing the template as 
whole. See details below. Be sure NOT to mistake template options with property 
options - the later ones are processed by the property replacer and apply to a 
SINGLE property, only (and not the whole template).<br>
<br>
Template options are case-insensitive. Currently defined are: </p>
<p><b>sql</b> - format the string suitable for a SQL statement in MySQL format. This will 
replace single quotes (&quot;'&quot;) and the backslash character by their 
backslash-escaped counterpart (&quot;\'&quot; and &quot;\\&quot;) inside each field. Please note 
that in MySQL configuration, the <code class="literal">NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> 
mode must be turned off for this format to work (this is the default).</p>
<p><b>stdsql</b> - format the string suitable for a SQL statement that is to be 
sent to a standards-compliant sql server. This will 
replace single quotes (&quot;'&quot;) by two single quotes (&quot;''&quot;) inside each field. 
You must use stdsql together with MySQL if in MySQL configuration the
<code class="literal">NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> is turned on.</p>
<p>Either the <b>sql</b> or <b>stdsql</b>&nbsp; 
option <b>must</b> be specified when a template is used for writing to a database, 
otherwise injection might occur. Please note that due to the unfortunate fact 
that several vendors have violated the sql standard and introduced their own 
escape methods, it is impossible to have a single option doing all the work.&nbsp; 
So you yourself must make sure you are using the right format. <b>If you choose 
the wrong one, you are still vulnerable to sql injection.</b><br>
<br>
Please note that the database writer *checks* that the sql option is present in 
the template. If it is not present, the write database action is disabled. This 
is to guard you against accidential forgetting it and then becoming vulnerable 
to SQL injection. The sql option can also be useful with files - especially if 
you want to import them into a database on another machine for performance 
reasons. However, do NOT use it if you do not have a real need for it - among 
others, it takes some toll on the processing time. Not much, but on a really 
busy system you might notice it ;)</p>
<p>The default template for the write to database action has the sql option set. 
As we currently support only MySQL and the sql option matches the default MySQL 
configuration, this is a good choice. However, if you have turned on
<code class="literal">NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES</code> in your MySQL config, you need 
to supply a template with the stdsql option. Otherwise you will become 
vulnerable to SQL injection. <br>
<br>
To escape:<br>
% = \%<br>
\ = \\ --&gt; '\' is used to escape (as in C)<br>
$template TraditionalFormat,%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg%\n&quot;<br>
<br>
Properties can be accessed by the <a href="property_replacer.html">property replacer</a> 
(see there for details).</p>
<h2>Output Channels</h2>
<p>Output Channels are a new concept first introduced in rsyslog 0.9.0. As of this 
writing, it is still unclear if they will stay in rsyslog or go away. So if you 
use them, be prepared to change you configuration file syntax when you upgrade 
to a later release.<br>
<br>
The idea behind output channel definitions is that it shall provide an umbrella 
for any type of output that the user might want. In essence,<br>
this is the &quot;file&quot; part of selector lines (and this is why we are not sure 
output channel syntax will stay after the next review). There is a<br>
difference, though: selector channels both have filter conditions (currently 
facility and severity) as well as the output destination. Output channels define 
the output defintion, only. As of this build, they can only be used to write to 
files - not pipes, ttys or whatever else. If we stick with output channels, this 
will change over time.</p>
<p>In concept, an output channel includes everything needed to know about an 
output actions. In practice, the current implementation only carries<br>
a filename, a maximum file size and a command to be issued when this file size 
is reached. More things might be present in future version, which might also 
change the syntax of the directive.</p>
<p>Output channels are defined via an $outchannel directive. It's syntax is as 
follows:<br>
<br>
$outchannel name,file-name,max-size,action-on-max-size<br>
<br>
name is the name of the output channel (not the file), file-name is the file 
name to be written to, max-size the maximum allowed size and action-on-max-size 
a command to be issued when the max size is reached.<br>
<br>
Please note that max-size is queried BEFORE writing the log message to the file. 
So be sure to set this limit reasonably low so that any message might fit. For 
the current release, setting it 1k lower than you expected is helpful. The 
max-size must always be specified in bytes - there are no special symbols (like 
1k, 1m,...) at this point of development.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that $outchannel just defines a channel with &quot;name&quot;. It does not 
activate it. To do so, you must use a selector line (see below). That selector 
line includes the channel name plus an $ sign in front of it. A sample might be:<br>
<br>
*.* $mychannel<br>
<br>
In its current form, output channels primarily provide the ability to size-limit 
an output file. To do so, specify a maximum size. When this size is reachead, 
rsyslogd will execute the action-on-max-size command and then reopen the file 
and retry. The command should be something like a log rotation script or a 
similar thing.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>WARNING</b>
	<p>The current command logic is a quick hack. It simply issues the command via a 
system() call, which is very dirty. Don't make rsyslogd a suid
binary and use action-on-max-size commands - this will mess up things. Fixing 
this is on top of the todo list and the fix will hopefully
appear soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is no action-on-max-size command or the command did not resolve the 
situation, the file is closed and never reopened by rsyslogd (except, of course, 
by huping it). This logic was integrated when we first experienced severe issues 
with files larger 2gb, which could lead to rsyslogd dumping core. In such cases, 
it is more appropriate to stop writing to a single file. Meanwhile, rsyslogd has 
been fixed to support files larger 2gb, but obviously only on file systems and 
operating system versions that do so. So it can still make sense to enforce a 
2gb file size limit.</p>
<h2>Filter Conditions</h2>
<p>Rsyslog offers two different types &quot;filter conditions&quot;:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;traditional&quot; severity and facility based selectors</li>
	<li>property-based filters</li>
</ul>
<h3>Blocks</h3>
<p>Rsyslogd supports BSD-style blocks inside rsyslog.conf. Each block of lines 
is separated from the previous block by a program or hostname specification. A 
block will only log messages corresponding to the most recent program and 
hostname specifications given. Thus, a block which selects ‘ppp’ as the program, 
directly followed by a block that selects messages from the hostname ‘dialhost’, 
then the second block will only log messages from the ppp program on dialhost.
</p>
<p>A program specification is a line beginning with ‘!prog’ and the following 
blocks will be associated with calls to syslog from that specific program. A 
program specification for ‘foo’ will also match any message logged by the kernel 
with the prefix ‘foo: ’. A hostname specification of the form ‘+hostname’ and 
the following blocks will be applied to messages received from the specified 
hostname. Alternatively, a hostname specification ‘-hostname’ causes the 
following blocks to be applied to messages from any host but the one specified. 
If the hostname is given as ‘@’, the local hostname will be used. (NOT YET 
IMPLEMENTED) A program or hostname specification may be reset by giving the 
program or hostname as ‘*’.</p>
<p>Please note that the &quot;#!prog&quot;, &quot;#+hostname&quot; and &quot;#-hostname&quot; syntax available 
in BSD syslogd is not supported by rsyslogd. By default, no hostname or program 
is set.</p>
<h3>Selectors</h3>
<p><b>Selectors are the traditional way of filtering syslog messages.</b> They 
have been kept in rsyslog with their orginal syntax, because it is well-known, 
highly effective and also needed for compatibility with stock syslogd 
configuration files. If you just need to filter based on priority and facility, 
you should do this with selector lines. They are <b>not</b> second-class 
citicens in rsyslog and offer the best performance for this job.</p>
<p>The selector field itself again consists of two parts, a facility and a 
priority, separated by a period (``.''). Both parts are case insenstive and can 
also be specified as decimal numbers, but don't do that, you have been warned. 
Both facilities and priorities are described in rsyslog(3). The names mentioned 
below correspond to the similar LOG_-values in /usr/include/rsyslog.h.<br><br>The facility is one of the following keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, 
kern, lpr, mail, mark, news, security (same as auth), syslog, user, uucp and 
local0 through local7. The keyword security should not be used anymore and mark 
is only for internal use and therefore should not be used in applications. 
Anyway, you may want to specify and redirect these messages here. The facility 
specifies the subsystem that produced the message, i.e. all mail programs log 
with the mail facility (LOG_MAIL) if they log using syslog.<br><br>Please note that the upcoming next syslog-RFC specifies many more facilities. 
Support for them will be added in a future version of rsyslog, which might 
require changes to existing configuration files.<br><br>The priority is one of the following keywords, in ascending order: debug, info, 
notice, warning, warn (same as warning), err, error (same as err), crit, alert, 
emerg, panic (same as emerg). The keywords error, warn and panic are deprecated 
and should not be used anymore. The priority defines the severity of the message<br>
<br>The behavior of the original BSD syslogd is that all messages of the specified 
priority and higher are logged according to the given action. Rsyslogd behaves the same, but has some extensions.<br><br>In addition to the above mentioned names the rsyslogd(8) understands the 
following extensions: An asterisk (``*'') stands for all facilities or all 
priorities, depending on where it is used (before or after the period). The 
keyword none stands for no priority of the given facility.<br><br>You can specify multiple facilities with the same priority pattern in one 
statement using the comma (``,'') operator. You may specify as much facilities 
as you want. Remember that only the facility part from such a statement is 
taken, a priority part would be skipped.</p>
<p>Multiple selectors may be specified for a single action using the semicolon 
(``;'') separator. Remember that each selector in the selector field is capable 
to overwrite the preceding ones. Using this behavior you can exclude some 
priorities from the pattern.</p>
<p>Rsyslogd has a syntax extension to the original BSD source, that makes its 
use more intuitively. You may precede every priority with an equation sign 
(``='') to specify only this single priority and not any of the above. You may 
also (both is valid, too) precede the priority with an exclamation mark (``!'') 
to ignore all that priorities, either exact this one or this and any higher 
priority. If you use both extensions than the exclamation mark must occur before 
the equation sign, just use it intuitively.</p>
<h3>Property-Based Filters</h3>
<p>Property-based filters are unique to rsyslogd. They allow to filter on any 
property, like HOSTNAME, syslogtag and msg. A list of all currently-supported 
properties can be found in the <a href="property_replacer.html">property 
replacer documentation</a> (but keep in mind that only the properties, not the 
replacer is supported). With this filter, each properties can be checked against 
a specified value, using a specified compare operation. Currently, there is only 
a single compare operation (contains) available, but additional operations will be added in the 
future.</p>
<p>A property-based filter must start with a colon in column 0. This tells 
rsyslogd that it is the new filter type. The colon must be followed by the 
property name, a comma, the name of the compare operation to carry out, another 
comma and then the value to compare against. This value must be quoted. There 
can be spaces and tabs between the commas. Property names and compare operations 
are case-sensitive, so &quot;msg&quot; works, while &quot;MSG&quot; is an invalid property name. In 
brief, the syntax is as follows:</p>
<p><code><b>:property, [!]compare-operation, &quot;value&quot;</b></code></p>
<p>The following <b>compare-operations</b> are currently supported:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td>contains</td>
		<td>Checks if the string provided in value is contained in the property. 
		There must be an exact match, wildcards are not supported.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>isequal</td>
		<td>Compares the &quot;value&quot; string provided and the property contents. 
		These two values must be exactly equal to match. The difference to 
		contains is that contains searchs for the value anywhere inside the 
		property value, whereas all characters must be identical for isequal. As 
		such, isequal is most useful for fields like syslogtag or FROMHOST, 
		where you probably know the exact contents.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>startswith</td>
		<td>Checks if the value is found exactly at the beginning of the 
		property value. For example, if you search for &quot;val&quot; with<p><code><b>:msg, 
		startswith, &quot;val&quot;</b></code></p>
		<p>it will be a match if msg contains &quot;values are in this message&quot; but 
		it won't match if the msg contains &quot;There are values in this message&quot; 
		(in the later case, contains would match). Please note that &quot;startswith&quot; 
		is by far faster than regular expressions. So even once they are 
		implemented, it can make very much sense (performance-wise) to use &quot;startswith&quot;.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>regex</td>
		<td><b>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</b> - value holds an regular expression</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>You can use the bang-character (!) immediately in front of a 
compare-operation, the outcome of this operation is negated. For example, if msg 
contains &quot;This is an informative message&quot;, the following sample would not match:</p>
<p><code><b>:msg, contains, &quot;error&quot;</b></code></p>
<p>but this one matches:</p>
<p><code><b>:msg, !contains, &quot;error&quot;</b></code></p>
<p>Using negation can be useful if you would like to do some generic processing 
but exclude some specific events. You can use the discard action in conjunction 
with that. A sample would be:</p>
<p><code><b>*.* /var/log/allmsgs-including-informational.log<br>
:msg, contains, &quot;informational&quot;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000" size="4">~</font>
<br>*.* /var/log/allmsgs-but-informational.log</b></code></p>
<p>Do not overlook the red tilde in line 2! In this sample, all messages are 
written to the file allmsgs-including-informational.log. Then, all messages 
containing the string &quot;informational&quot; are discarded. That means the config file 
lines below the &quot;discard line&quot; (number 2 in our sample) will not be applied to 
this message. Then, all remaining lines will also be written to the file 
allmsgs-but-informational.log.</p>
<p><b>Value</b> is a quoted string. It supports some escape sequences:</p>
<p>\&quot; - the quote character (e.g. &quot;String with \&quot;Quotes\&quot;&quot;)<br>
\\ - the backslash character (e.g. &quot;C:\\tmp&quot;)</p>
<p>Escape sequences always start with a backslash. Additional escape sequences 
might be added in the future. Backslash characters <b>must</b> be escaped. Any 
other sequence then those outlined above is invalid and may lead to 
unpredictable results.</p>
<p>Probably, &quot;msg&quot; is the most prominent use case of property based filters. It 
is the actual message text. If you would like to filter based on some message 
content (e.g. the presence of a specific code), this can be done easily by:</p>
<p><code><b>:msg, contains, &quot;ID-4711&quot;</b></code></p>
<p>This filter will match when the message contains the string &quot;ID-4711&quot;. Please 
note that the comparison is case-sensitive, so it would not match if &quot;id-4711&quot; 
would be contained in the message.</p>
<p>Getting property-based filters right can sometimes be challenging. In order 
to help you do it with as minimal effort as possible, rsyslogd spits out debug 
information for all property-based filters during their evaluation. To enable 
this, run rsyslogd in foreground and specify the &quot;-d&quot; option.</p>
<p>Boolean operations inside property based filters (like 'message contains 
&quot;ID17&quot; or message contains &quot;ID18&quot;') are currently not supported 
(except for &quot;not&quot; as outlined above). Please note 
that while it is possible to query facility and severity via property-based filters, 
it is far more advisable to use classic selectors (see above) for those 
cases.</p>
<h2>ACTIONS</h2>
<p>The action field of a rule describes what to do with the message. In general, 
message content is written to a kind of &quot;logfile&quot;. But also other actions might 
be done, like writing to a database table or forwarding to another host.<br>
<br>
Templates can be used with all actions. If used, the specified template is used 
to generate the message content (instead of the default template). To specify a 
template, write a semicolon after the action value immediately followed by the 
template name.<br>
<br>
Beware: templates MUST be defined BEFORE they are used. It is OK to define some 
templates, then use them in selector lines, define more templates and use use 
them in the following selector lines. But it is NOT permitted to use a template 
in a selectore line that is above its definition. If you do this, the selector 
line will be ignored.</p>
<h3>Regular File</h3>
<p>Typically messages are logged to real files. The file has to be specified with 
full pathname, beginning with a slash &quot;/''.<br>
<br>
You may prefix each entry with the minus ``-'' sign to omit syncing the file 
after every logging. Note that you might lose information if the system crashes 
right behind a write attempt. Nevertheless this might give you back some 
performance, especially if you run programs that use<br>
logging in a very verbose manner.</p>
<p>If your system is connected to a reliable UPS and you receive lots of log 
data (e.g. firewall logs), it might be a very good idea to turn of
syncing by specifying the &quot;-&quot; in front of the file name. </p>
<h3>Named Pipes</h3>
<p>This version of rsyslogd(8) has support for logging output to named pipes (fifos). 
A fifo or named pipe can be used as a destination for log messages by prepending 
a pipe symbol (``|'') to the name of the file. This is handy for debugging. Note 
that the fifo must be created with the mkfifo(1) command before rsyslogd(8) is 
started.</p>
<h3>Terminal and Console</h3>
<p>If the file you specified is a tty, special tty-handling is done, same with 
/dev/console.</p>
<h3>Remote Machine</h3>
<p>Rsyslogd provides full remote logging, i.e. is able to send messages to a 
remote host running rsyslogd(8) and to receive messages from remote hosts. The 
remote host won't forward the message again, it will just log them locally. To 
forward messages to another host, prepend the hostname with the at sign (``@'').<br>
<br>
Using this feature you're able to control all syslog messages on one host, if 
all other machines will log remotely to that. This tears down<br>
administration needs.<br>
<br>
Please note that this version of rsyslogd by default does NOT forward messages 
it has received from the network to another host. Specify the<br>
-h option to enable this.</p>
<h3>List of Users</h3>
<p>Usually critical messages are also directed to ``root'' on that machine. You can 
specify a list of users that shall get the message by simply writing the login. 
You may specify more than one user by separating them with commas (&quot;,''). If 
they're logged in they get the message. Don't think a mail would be sent, that 
might be too late.</p>
<h3>Everyone logged on</h3>
<p>Emergency messages often go to all users currently online to notify them that 
something strange is happening with the system. To specify this wall(1)-feature 
use an asterisk (&quot;*'').</p>
<h3>Database Table</h3>
<p>This allows logging of the message to a database table. Currently, only MySQL 
databases are supported. By default, a MonitorWare-compatible schema is required 
for this to work. You can create that schema with the createDB.SQL file that 
came with the rsyslog package. You can also<br>
use any other schema of your liking - you just need to define a proper template 
and assign this template to the action.<br>
<br>
The database writer is called by specifying a greater-then sign (&quot;&gt;&quot;) in front 
of the database connect information. Immediately after that<br>
sign the database host name must be given, a comma, the database name, another 
comma, the database user, a comma and then the user's password. If a specific 
template is to be used, a semicolong followed by the template name can follow 
the connect information. This is as follows:<br>
<br>
&gt;dbhost,dbname,dbuser,dbpassword;dbtemplate</p>
<h3>Discard</h3>
<p>If the discard action is carried out, the received message is immediately 
discarded. No further processing of it occurs. Discard has primarily been added 
to filter out messages before carrying on any further processing. For obvious 
reasons, the results of &quot;discard&quot; are depending on where in the configuration 
file it is being used. Please note that once a message has been discarded there 
is no way to retrive it in later configuration file lines.</p>
<p>Discard can be highly effective if you want to filter out some annoying 
messages that otherwise would fill your log files. To do that, place the discard 
actions early in your log files. This often plays well with property-based 
filters, giving you great freedom in specifying what you do not want.</p>
<p>Discard is just the single tilde character with no further parameters:</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>*.*&nbsp;&nbsp; ~</p>
<p>discards everything (ok, you can achive the same by not running rsyslogd at 
all...).</p>
<h3>Output Channel</h3>
<p>Binds an output channel definition (see there for details) to this action. 
Output channel actions must start with a $-sign, e.g. if you would like to bind 
your output channel definition &quot;mychannel&quot; to the action, use &quot;$mychannel&quot;. 
Output channels support template definitions like all all other actions.</p>
<h3>Shell Execute</h3>
<p>This executes a program in a subshell. The programm is passed the 
template-generated message as the only command line parameter. Rsyslog waits 
until the program terminates and only then continues to run.</p>
<p>^programm-to-execute;template</p>
<p>The program-to-execute can be any valid executable.</p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> The Shell Execute action was added to serve an urgent need. 
While it is considered reasonable save when used with some thinking, its 
implications must be considered. The current implementation uses a system() call 
to execute the command. This is not the best way to do it (and will hopefully 
changed in further releases). Also, proper escaping of special characters is 
done to prevent command injection. However, attackers always find smart ways to 
circumvent escaping, so we can not say if the escaping applied will really safe 
you from all hassles. Lastely, rsyslog will wait until the shell command 
terminates. Thus, a program error in it (e.g. an infinite loop) can actually 
disable rsyslog. Even without that, during the programs run-time no messages are 
processed by rsyslog. As the IP stacks buffers are quickly overflowed, this 
bears an increased risk of message loss. You must be aware of these implications. 
Even though they are severe, there are several cases where the &quot;shell execute&quot; 
action is very useful. This is the reason why we have included it in its current 
form. To mitigate its risks, always a) test your program thouroughly, b) make 
sure its runtime is as short as possible (if it requires a longer run-time, you 
might want to spawn your own sub-shell asynchronously), c) apply proper 
firewalling so that only known senders can send syslog messages to rsyslog. 
Point c) is especially important: if rsyslog is accepting message from any hosts, 
chances are much higher that an attacker might try to exploit the &quot;shell execute&quot; 
action.</p>
<h2>TEMPLATE NAME</h2>
<p>Every ACTION can be followed by a template name. If so, that template is used 
for message formatting. If no name is given, a hardcoded default template is 
used for the action. There can only be one template name for each given action. 
The default template is specific to each action. For a description of what a 
template is and what you can do with it, see &quot;TEMPLATES&quot; at the top of this 
document.</p>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>Below are example for templates and selector lines. I hope they are 
self-explanatory. If not, please see www.monitorware.com/rsyslog/ for advise.</p>
<h3>TEMPLATES</h3>
<p>Please note that the samples are split across multiple lines. A template MUST 
NOT actually be split across multiple lines.<br>
<br>
A template that resambles traditional syslogd file output:<br>
$template TraditionalFormat,&quot;%timegenerated% %HOSTNAME%<br>
%syslogtag%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n&quot;<br>
<br>
A template that tells you a little more about the message:<br>
$template precise,&quot;%syslogpriority%,%syslogfacility%,%timegenerated%,%HOSTNAME%,<br>
%syslogtag%,%msg%\n&quot;<br>
<br>
A template for RFC 3164 format:<br>
$template RFC3164fmt,&quot;&lt;%PRI%&gt;%TIMESTAMP% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg%&quot;<br>
<br>
A template for the format traditonally used for user messages:<br>
$template usermsg,&quot; XXXX%syslogtag%%msg%\n\r&quot;<br>
<br>
And a template with the traditonal wall-message format:<br>
$template wallmsg,&quot;\r\n\7Message from syslogd@%HOSTNAME% at %timegenerated%<br>
<br>
A template that can be used for the database write (please note the SQL<br>
template option)<br>
$template MySQLInsert,&quot;insert iut, message, receivedat values<br>
('%iut%', '%msg:::UPPERCASE%', '%timegenerated:::date-mysql%')<br>
into systemevents\r\n&quot;, SQL<br>
<br>
The following template emulates <a href="http://www.winsyslog.com/en/">WinSyslog</a> 
format (it's an <a href="http://www.adiscon.com/en/">Adiscon</a> format, you do 
not feel bad if you don't know it ;)). It's interesting to see how it takes 
different parts out of the date stamps. What happens is that the date stamp is 
split into the actual date and time and the these two are combined with just a 
comma in between them.<br>
<br>
$template WinSyslogFmt,&quot;%HOSTNAME%,%timegenerated:1:10:date-rfc3339%,<br>
%timegenerated:12:19:date-rfc3339%,%timegenerated:1:10:date-rfc3339%,<br>
%timegenerated:12:19:date-rfc3339%,%syslogfacility%,%syslogpriority%,<br>
%syslogtag%%msg%\n&quot;</p>
<h3>SELECTOR LINES</h3>
<p># Store critical stuff in critical<br>
#<br>
*.=crit;kern.none /var/adm/critical<br>
<br>
This will store all messages with the priority crit in the file /var/adm/critical, 
except for any kernel message.<br>
<br>
<br>
# Kernel messages are first, stored in the kernel<br>
# file, critical messages and higher ones also go<br>
# to another host and to the console. Messages to<br>
# the host finlandia are forwarded in RFC 3164<br>
# format (using the template defined above).<br>
#<br>
kern.* /var/adm/kernel<br>
kern.crit @finlandia;RFC3164fmt<br>
kern.crit /dev/console<br>
kern.info;kern.!err /var/adm/kernel-info<br>
<br>
The first rule direct any message that has the kernel facility to the file /var/adm/kernel.<br>
<br>
The second statement directs all kernel messages of the priority crit and higher 
to the remote host finlandia. This is useful, because if the host crashes and 
the disks get irreparable errors you might not be able to read the stored 
messages. If they're on a remote host, too, you still can try to find out the 
reason for the crash.<br>
<br>
The third rule directs these messages to the actual console, so the person who 
works on the machine will get them, too.<br>
<br>
The fourth line tells rsyslogd to save all kernel messages that come with 
priorities from info up to warning in the file /var/adm/kernel-info. Everything 
from err and higher is excluded.<br>
<br>
<br>
# The tcp wrapper loggs with mail.info, we display<br>
# all the connections on tty12<br>
#<br>
mail.=info /dev/tty12<br>
<br>
This directs all messages that uses mail.info (in source LOG_MAIL | LOG_INFO) to 
/dev/tty12, the 12th console. For example the tcpwrapper tcpd(8) uses this as 
it's default.<br>
<br>
<br>
# Store all mail concerning stuff in a file<br>
#<br>
mail.*;mail.!=info /var/adm/mail<br>
<br>
This pattern matches all messages that come with the mail facility, except for 
the info priority. These will be stored in the file /var/adm/mail.<br>
<br>
<br>
# Log all mail.info and news.info messages to info<br>
#<br>
mail,news.=info /var/adm/info<br>
<br>
This will extract all messages that come either with mail.info or with news.info 
and store them in the file /var/adm/info.<br>
<br>
<br>
# Log info and notice messages to messages file<br>
#<br>
*.=info;*.=notice;\<br>
mail.none /var/log/messages<br>
<br>
This lets rsyslogd log all messages that come with either the info or the notice 
facility into the file /var/log/messages, except for all<br>
messages that use the mail facility.<br>
<br>
<br>
# Log info messages to messages file<br>
#<br>
*.=info;\<br>
mail,news.none /var/log/messages<br>
<br>
This statement causes rsyslogd to log all messages that come with the info 
priority to the file /var/log/messages. But any message coming either with the 
mail or the news facility will not be stored.<br>
<br>
<br>
# Emergency messages will be displayed using wall<br>
#<br>
*.=emerg *<br>
<br>
This rule tells rsyslogd to write all emergency messages to all currently logged 
in users. This is the wall action.<br>
<br>
<br>
# Messages of the priority alert will be directed<br>
# to the operator<br>
#<br>
*.alert root,rgerhards<br>
<br>
This rule directs all messages with a priority of alert or higher to the 
terminals of the operator, i.e. of the users ``root'' and ``rgerhards'' if 
they're logged in.<br>
<br>
<br>
*.* @finlandia<br>
<br>
This rule would redirect all messages to a remote host called finlandia. This is 
useful especially in a cluster of machines where all syslog messages will be 
stored on only one machine.<br>
<br>
In the format shown above, UDP is used for transmitting the message. The 
destination port is set to the default auf 514. Rsyslog is also capable of using 
much more secure and reliable TCP sessions for message forwarding. Also, the 
destination port can be specified. To select TCP, simply add one additional @ in 
front of the host name (that is, @host is UPD, @@host is TCP). For example:<br>
<br>
<br>
*.* @@finlandia<br>
<br>
To specify the destination port on the remote machine, use a colon followed by 
the port number after the machine name. The following forwards to port 1514 on 
finlandia:<br>
<br>
<br>
*.* @@finlandia:1514<br>
<br>
This syntax works both with TCP and UDP based syslog. However, you will probably 
primarily need it for TCP, as there is no well-accepted port for this transport 
(it is non-standard). For UDP, you can usually stick with the default auf 514, 
but might want to modify it for security rea-<br>
sons. If you would like to do that, it's quite easy:<br>
<br>
<br>
*.* @finlandia:1514<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*.* &gt;dbhost,dbname,dbuser,dbpassword;dbtemplate<br>
<br>
This rule writes all message to the database &quot;dbname&quot; hosted on &quot;dbhost&quot;. The 
login is done with user &quot;dbuser&quot; and password &quot;dbpassword&quot;. The actual table 
that is updated is specified within the template (which contains the insert 
statement). The template is called &quot;dbtemplate&quot; in this case.</p>
<p>:msg,contains,&quot;error&quot; @errorServer</p>
<p>This rule forwards all messages that contain the word &quot;error&quot; in the msg part 
to the server &quot;errorServer&quot;. Forwarding is via UDP. Please note the colon in 
fron</p>
<h2>CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES</h2>
<p>Rsyslogd uses a slightly different syntax for its configuration file than the 
original BSD sources. Originally all messages of a specific priority and above 
were forwarded to the log file. The modifiers ``='', ``!'' and ``-'' were added 
to make rsyslogd more flexible and to use it in a more intuitive manner.<br>
<br>
The original BSD syslogd doesn't understand spaces as separators between the 
selector and the action field.<br>
<br>
When compared to syslogd from sysklogd package, rsyslogd offers additional
<a href="features.html">features</a> (like template and database support). For obvious reasons, the syntax for 
defining such features is available 
in rsyslogd, only.<br>

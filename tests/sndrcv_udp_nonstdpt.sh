# This runs sends and receives messages via UDP to the non-standard port 2514
# Note that with UDP we can always have message loss. While this is
# less likely in a local environment, we strongly limit the amount of data
# we send in the hope to not lose any messages. However, failure of this
# test does not necessarily mean that the code is wrong (but it is very likely!)

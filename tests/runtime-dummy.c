/* Testbench for rsyslog
 *
 * This are dummy calls for "runtime" routines which are not yet properly
 * abstracted and part of the actual runtime libraries. This module tries
 * to make the linker happy. Please note that it does NOT provide anything
 * more but the symbols. If a test requires these functions (or functions
 * that depend on them), this dummy can not be used.

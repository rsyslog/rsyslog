# test many concurrent tcp connections
# we send 100,000 messages in the hopes that his puts at least a little bit
# of pressure on the threading subsystem. To really prove it, we would need to
# push messages for several minutes, but that takes too long during the 
# automatted tests (hint: do this manually after suspect changes). Thankfully,
# in practice many threading bugs result in an abort rather quickly and these
# should be covered by this test here.

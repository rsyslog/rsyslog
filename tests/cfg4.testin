# This is more or less the sample config, but without imklog being
# active. imklog must not always be present and as such may spoil
# our testing result. The core point at this test is that a valid
# config file should not lead to any error messages.
# It may be a good idea to update this file from time to time, so that
# it contains a reasonable complex config sample.

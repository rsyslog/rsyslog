# Test for DA mode on the main message queue
# This test checks if DA mode operates correctly. To do so,
# it uses a small in-memory queue size, so that DA mode is initiated
# rather soon, and disk spooling used. There is some uncertainty (based
# on machine speeds), but in general the test should work rather well.
# We add a few messages after the initial run, just so that we can
# check everything recovers from DA mode correctly.

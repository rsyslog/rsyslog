# This tests async writing with only a small set of data. That
# shall result in data staying in buffers until shutdown, what
# then will trigger some somewhat complex logic in the stream
# writer (open, write, close all during the stream close
# operation). It is vital that only few messages be sent.
#
# The main effort of this test is not (only) to see if we
# receive the data, but rather to see if we get into an abort
# condition.

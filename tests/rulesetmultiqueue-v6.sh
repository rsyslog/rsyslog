# Test for disk-only queue mode with v6+ config
# This tests defines three rulesets, each one with its own queue. Then, it
# sends data to them and checks the outcome. Note that we do need to
# use some custom code as the test driver framework does not (yet?)
# support multi-output-file operations.

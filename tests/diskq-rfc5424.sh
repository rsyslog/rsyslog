# detect queue corruption based on invalid property bag ordering.
# Note: this mimics an issue actually seen in practice.
# Triggering condition: "json" property (message variables) are present
# and "structured-data" property is also present. Caused rsyslog to
# thrash the queue file, getting messages stuck in it and loosing all
# after the initial problem occurence.

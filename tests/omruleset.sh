# Basic test for omruleset. What we do is have the main queue forward 
# all messages to a secondary ruleset via omruleset, which then does
# the actual file write. We check if all messages arrive at the file, 
# what implies that omruleset works. No filters or special queue modes
# are used, so the message is re-enqueued into the main message queue.
# We inject just 5,000 message because we may otherwise run into
# queue full conditions (as we use the same queue) and that
# would result in longer execution time. In any case, 5000 messages
# are well enough to test what we want to test.

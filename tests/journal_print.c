/* A testing tool that tries to emit message given as argument
 * to the journal, and, if succceds (at least per journald retcode).
 * If whole operation is successful there is need to actually check
 * that message is present in journal (also veryfing journal read perms)
 *
 * Retcodes:	0 - success
 * 		1 - wrong arguments (expects exactly one)
 * 		2 - failed to open journal for writing
 * 		3 - failed to actually write message to journal
 *
 * Part of the testbench for rsyslog.

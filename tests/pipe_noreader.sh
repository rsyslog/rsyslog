# This is test driver for a pipe that has no reader. This mimics a usual
# real-world scenario, the /dev/xconsole pipe. Some versions of rsyslog
# were known to hang or loop on this pipe, thus we added this scenario
# as a permanent testcase. For some details, please see bug tracker
# http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=186
#
# IMPORTANT: we do NOT check any result message set. The whole point in
# this test is to verify that we do NOT run into an eternal loop. As such,
# the test is "PASS", if rsyslogd terminates. If it does not terminate, we
# obviously do not cause "FAIL", but processing will hang, which should be
# a good-enough indication of failure.

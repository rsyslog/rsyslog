# This test tests omprog using the default values for all non-mandatory
# settings. It also checks that command-line parameters are correctly
# passed to the external program.

# NOTE: Because the omprog feedback mode is not used in this test
# (confirmMessages=off), it is difficult to synchronize the execution
# of the external program with the test code. For this reason, it would
# be difficult to test for negative cases (e.g. restart of the program
# if it terminates prematurely) without making the test racy. So, we
# only test a happy case: the program processes all logs received and
# exits when the pipe is closed. After closing the pipe, omprog will
# wait for the program to terminate during a timeout of 5 seconds
# (default value of closeTimeout), which should be sufficient for the
# program to write its output.

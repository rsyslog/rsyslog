# sample.pmsnare_modoverride
# These are sample events from several source types, and their expected results with the pmsnare module
# when global settings are overridden. The input has been manipulated, as this feature is intended to 
# accommodate cases where input was already escaped elsewhere.

# Format for expect is:

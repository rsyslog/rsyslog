# This is a config include file. It sets up rsyslog so that the
# diag system can successfully be used. Also, it generates a file
# "rsyslogd.started" after rsyslogd is initialized. This config file
# should be included in all tests that intend to use common code for
# controlling the daemon.
# NOTE: we assume that rsyslogd's current working directory is 
# ./tests (or the distcheck equivalent), in particlular that this
# config file resides in the testsuites subdirectory.
